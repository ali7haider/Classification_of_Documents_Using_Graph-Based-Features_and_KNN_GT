Professional Development in North and South Carolina, vol. 4
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/professional-development-north-and-south-carolina-vol-4,"The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) launched theSmithsonian Science for North and South Carolina Classroomsprogram in 2019 with a U.S. Department of Education early phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR)grant. Read theprevious installmentin this blog series here. Margaret Lorimer is an Education Specialist atSolutions in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (STEM Centers SC)and formerly a K-8 mathematics teacher. She has attended and facilitated professional development for fifth grade teachers in South Carolina on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom modulesHow Can We Provide Freshwater to Those in Need?in summer 2021 andHow Can We Identify Materials Based on Their Properties?in summer 2022. We spoke with Margaret in 2021 after virtual professional development to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: What are the benefits to students who are experiencing theSmithsonian Science for the Classroommodules taught by trained teachers? Margaret: The kids when the modules are implemented are learning by doing. Theyre digging in and theyre able to interact with the content and to do some sense making of their own so that theyre understanding the concepts better. I think thats really the power of a system that uses these kinds of modules where the students are not just reading about the science, theyre actually interacting with it. Theyre doing experiments, have their hands on it, and have their brains engaged with it. They have opportunities to question and form ideas and then decide whether or not those ideas are viable and then come back around and say, well I dont think thats why this works, lets try it this way. SSEC: How would you describe the differences between the introductory and intermediate 5thgrade training sessions? Margaret: The introductory sessions focused on the content of the module and it was taking a look at the 5thgrade content and the science and engineering processes that were involved in teaching that content. The introductory piece was this is what kids will be doing, this is how kids do this. The intermediate PD was more about the science content knowledge for the teachers, giving them a chance to really dig into some of the science concepts themselves and build their own understanding. I really believe, and my experience has shown me this, that the deeper the teachers content knowledge is, the more flexible they can be in their instruction. They can work with students on their misconceptions and help them build their understanding of the content. SSEC:How do you seeSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacting South Carolina teachers? Margaret:The teachers are coming up with questions that they want to investigate based on the content in the modules that theyre learning. I hope that something like what happened to me happens to them where they go, oh wow, Ive thought this about that particular phenomenon, let me think about why it works the way that it does. I really think that its hard to teach what you havent experienced, I dont think its impossible, but I think that its hard and so if the teachers who have been through this training have fit it into their framework of thinking about science and how they think about science instruction then theyre going to take that in their classrooms and theyre going to give their kids the same opportunities that they had to question their thinking, interact, and learn. As it impacts the teachers, its going to impact the students.  In this screenshot from PD, Margaret facilitates a conversation with teachers. SSEC:How has leading professional development onSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacted your own practice? Margaret: When we did the professional development with Smithsonian, the train-the-trainer pieces, all the strategies that we want teachers to use with their kids, were embedded in that PD, so we experience the strategies as learners and then we want the teachers to take those. We want the folks who experienced those strategies that were embedded in that PD to then take it and use it with their students. For example, a lot of times when you think about your own instruction in science, when you were a learner, when you were a student, you get this list of vocabulary words and you find out what all the definitions of the vocabulary words are and then you do the learning about the science thats attached to the vocabulary words. But really, its better to have an experience that [the] vocabulary is embedded in and you have to use it to have the experience. Then at the back end you talk about the meanings of the words. That was embedded in the intermediate piece: that teaching strategy was introduced to them and they were encouraged to apply that to other science instruction. SSEC:What is the impact of this for you and how do you see this potentially changing science and STEM education? Margaret: People will not do what they have not experienced themselves. If the only science instruction theyve ever experienced is show and tell where I do it as the teacher, we do a few things together, and then you go and do some stuff on your own for practice, if thats all theyve ever experienced, thats how theyre going to teach. That makes perfect sense because we do what weve been taught to do, so having training like this that is based in inquiry, that is built around the science and engineering practices, if they experience it as learners, then they are much more likely to carry it into their classrooms and do it that way with their students. The strength of programs like theSmithsonian Science for the Classroomis the teacher support pieces. If Im a K-5 teacher and Im not real sure about my content, then Im going stick with whatever the textbook tells me to do, but if I have a Smithsonian module and Ive learned how to use it, then the teacher supports that are built into that make it much easier for me to take the risk to do science a little differently with my students, so thats where the power to make change comes in.",1009

Meet Nazanin Rastegradoost 
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/meet-nazanin-rastegradoost,"Nazanin Rastegradoost is a Wireless Communications Specialist with Ofinno. Nazanin shared how her first experiences with astronomy in Tehran, Iran shaped her outlook on STEM and inevitably led her to pursue a career with Ofinno.  Smithsonian Science Education Center: What was your first memorable experience with STEM? Nazanin: When I was in middle school, I was immediately attracted to an after-school astronomy club. We took trips to observatories and deserts throughout Tehran, Iran to watch meteor showers, identify constellations, and learn about the sky. We even built a tent to simulate the night sky and painted various constellations on the fabric. How were you able to nurture your interests throughout middle and high school? Once I was exposed to my schools math center, and with my mom helping me solve equations, I became even more interested in science and math. I went to a great school and learned from top-level instructors, especially in mathematics. I became really interested in geography, which is used frequently in astronomy. We solved these classic geometry theorems that were challenging, but also really fun. They felt like puzzles to me, and I was determined to solve all of them. How did your teachers, mentors, or family members help you pursue your interests? How did you decide what to pursue for your college major? I was trying to make sense of my life as a teenager. When I was in high school, I snuck a cell phone into school and I started asking questions about how cell phones workedit was pretty basic technology at the time. I wanted to figure out how I could talk to someone remotely at any time without using a wired connection. When I finished high school and started to decide on a college major, I selected electrical engineering because it focused heavily on math and I could study wireless communication. At what point did you realize that you could turn your passions into a career? When I started consulting with people about a college major, I observed a friends sister who was a wireless communications engineer. She traveled to different areas to solve peoples problems, and I realized that engineering could use design and math to solve real-world problems to help people. Once I started taking the basic courses for electrical engineering, I was eager to know more. These questions led me to graduate studies and a research career. Graduate school was tough, but it was amazing to see how it changed my professional viewpoints. Seeing myself grow and learn more about solving real-world problems led me to a research career within the industry. Were living in an ever-evolving world, especially within communications. As a wireless specialist, I can see the gaps in our connectivity and develop ideas on how to solve them. Is there anyone that currently inspires you to continue working in this particular field? I have the best team here at Ofinno, and theyre my main inspiration. My husband and family are proud to see me progress in this area, and their support is important to me. Can you describe your career path that led you to working at Ofinno? The day of my PhD dissertation defense, my professor invited a former student who started his own company. The following day after my defense, he offered me a role as an intern with Ofinno and I accepted. This allowed me to continue what I was studying in my PhD program in a more industrial way. A few months later, I started working as a full-time employee. What does an average day look like for you? My job entails quite a bit of reading and critical thinking about enhancements for projects. My colleagues and I have brainstorming sessions to develop strategies to solve issues within wireless communications. We try to find the most important problem and shape solutions for them in an applicable way for the real world. We patent our ideas and if its adopted, your idea is implemented in the device.  ",664

Professional Development in North and South Carolina, vol. 2
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/professional-development-north-and-south-carolina-vol-2,"The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) launched theSmithsonian Science for North and South Carolina Classroomsprogram in 2019 with a U.S. Department of Education early phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR)grant. Read the first installment in this blog serieshere. Donna Godley is a fifth grade science teacher at Tryon Elementary School in North Carolina and her school's site coordinator, responsible for supporting her fellow teachers and communicating with the other key players in the program. In March and August 2021, she attended professional development on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom moduleHow Can We Provide Freshwater to Those in Need?in preparation for implementing it with her students. We spoke with Donna to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: How did you feel when you learned you were going to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for North Carolina and South Carolina program? Did you have any expectations? Donna:Our Superintendent signed our school up and was looking for teachers to be a part of the program. I teach 5th grade science and were departmentalized. So after I volunteered, I also became a coordinator for my school. I worked with some of the Smithsonian Science units before and traveled to D.C. with other teachers for Smithsonian-related things several years ago. The quality of the Smithsonian programs are usually pretty good, so I felt like the effort I would be putting into it would be worth it for my students. What was your experience with the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom module you covered during the professional development? What was your experience going through the curriculum during the professional development? My unit was an [Engineering] design unit, and its about moving water from one area to another. The people that weve worked with anytime weve done the training have been great. Its been virtual, of course, because of COVID but the instructors have always been really good. The written materials, especially the teacher manual, is always so self explanatory because it covers everything in great detail. You can watch the videos if you have questions on anything. The teacher materials and the resources the Smithsonian Science Education Center provides are exceptional. Actually sitting through the material makes me more familiar with it, and I could teach the lessons without professional development because the materials are so high quality.  In this screenshot from PD, Donna describes her group's rationale for sorting images of landforms in a jamboard. What was it like for you to work with other teachers and coordinators during the training? It was great to receive feedback from others. I worked with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers from my school to help them figure out how they were going to teach the lessons. At the end of each year we hold a debrief to discuss highlights and how were going to work through certain challenges and implement them for the following school year. What has this experience been like for your students? The kids have loved it. With all of the hands-on activities, they say oh, were really scientists! It was so exciting for them to see crates of new materials they were going to work with. They really enjoy doing the design units because they had the opportunity to be creative and use the materials how they liked. Usually when Im doing things in my classroom, theres not a wealth of material to use and were limited to what Ive purchased. Everyone was very engaged because they were so enthralled with everything they were getting to use. They really enjoy being creative and it has really helped them with teamwork. In 5th grade, getting along and working together is a challenge. Theyre motivated to work together during this unit, which is a great thing to have toward the end of the school year. What is a memorable takeaway for you from professional development training? Actually doing the materials together was really impactful to me. Were learning how to move water from one place to another and design water filtration systems. There were some funny moments along the way that were memorable tooat one point my filter completely collapsed! When I started doing this unit with the kids, I could make suggestions along the way so that they didnt completely lose everything. How has this professional development challenged you to think differently about science education? Ive always considered myself a constructionist, where I dont tell students things but let them discover it for themselves. This professional development reemphasized that method of teaching and how important it is. Once the students learn it for themselves, they dont forget it. If theyre just told what to do, it goes in one ear and out the other. If they discover it for themselves, they can apply it to other situations.",800

A Global Goals Guide: From Start to Finish
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/global-goals-guide-start-finish,"You may be familiar with the action-focused aim of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals guides. As explained by Laurie Rosatone, Division Director of Curriculum, Digital Media, and Communications at the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC), the goal is to have anyone picking up these guides feel like there is something that they want to and can do and that they can act in their local communities around these huge global challenges. So, how does the SSEC strive toward this goal while creating the Global Goals guides? How are topics selected among the many issues that the world is facing? Whats the process for developing activities that are as engaging as possible? How is each guide created with accessibility and impact in mind? As an intern for the upcomingBiotechnology!community research guide, I talked with the rest of the SSEC team to dig into these big questions. Heres everything that goes into a Global Goals guide, from start to finish. Each guides beginning traces all the way back to 20162018, when a deep dive into the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals produced alist of tentative topics. Since then, funders have helped to transform the early vision into reality: published guides used by young people around the world! The process of connecting with funders begins with Holly Glover, SSEC's Division Director of Advancement and Partnerships. She says, Since the inception of the SDGs, interest from the funding community around education for sustainable development has grown significantly. These funding partners are excited to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Project. As we are seeking to achieve a joint impact with partners, I look at which guides and resources are left unfunded, and seek to align those priority areas with those of our partners. For theBiotechnology!guide, she explains, Biotechnology!was funded by Johnson & Johnson, whose business and philanthropic priorities align to the topics covered within the guide. After receiving funding, the first step is getting organized. Hannah Osborn, Project Manager at SSEC, starts by creating a schedule. She says of her work, I start with the questions, What have we been tasked to do? What is our timeline? How does our budget line up? I then backflow a schedule from there. Once the timeline is constructed, the research begins. The curriculum developers start to explore by digging into big issues surrounding the guides topic and consulting key players in the field. That research is synthesized into an outline detailing the proposed parts of the guide and the essential understandings students will develop while using it. After high-level review and approval of the outline, the guide is ready to move onto the drafting stage. As an intern, I worked with Curriculum Developers Heidi Gibson and Logan Schmidt to conduct further background research and develop activities for the upcomingBiotechnology!guide. Along with our five-strong intern team (made up of high schoolers, college students, and teachers!), I identified sources, probed through research papers, and conducted interviews with subject matter experts to get a strong understanding of each topic. We then worked on integrating key takeaways into engaging activities, which involved brainstorming, gathering data and information, and writing drafts. As we wrapped up our work, Heidi and Logan incorporated the research and activities into writing the initial draft of the guide. This first draft then goes through a rigorous review process that involves a number of voices. Field testing is done with teachers around the world to obtain their feedback as guide users. Technical reviews by experts ensure that the information shared in the guides is scientifically accurate and clear. Internal feedback, involving reviews by Laurie Rosatone and SSEC Director Dr. Carol ODonnell, provide further suggestions that make the guide as user-friendly and impactful as possible. After all of this feedback is integrated into improving the draft, the guide is copy-edited and designed by professionals. Then, it is finally ready to be published! SSECs Marketing & Communications team spreads the word about the completely free, newly released guide through digital marketing (i.e. social media posts and paid advertisements), blog posts, and press releases. Once the guide is released and shared, students and educators everywhere can access it from their devices. To expand the impact of Global Goals, Katherine Blanchard, Assistant Director of Professional Services, and Jackie Kolb, Program Specialist work with educators to implement the guides in their learning communities. Katherine says of their work, When a guide is first released, theres a balance between marketing and implementationwhos sharing that this exists versus whos providing training to actually use it. That gap between knowing about it and using it is one of the biggest things we work to fill. Theres a lot of recruitment of interested educators, building out and developing partnerships for projects (e.g. implementation in certain countries), and working with educators to implement the guides. Finally, the guide enters the final, paramount stage: being used by youth around the world! From beginning to end, youths interests and their ability to ignite change are the foundation of the guides themselves, as Laurie explains: Bringing respect for different peoples backgrounds, lived experiences, and perspectives of problem-solving into the classroom is at the heart of these Global Goals guides. Youre starting with the youthwho arethey? Instead of Who am I to think that I can do science? its Here I am and heres what Im bringing to this. It is really powerful to think about that subtle shift being that important to unlocking students confidence, curiosity, and sense of connection. Its not about empowering them, its tapping into their own sense of agency. I want to give them the confidence that they have the knowledge to step forward. Guide users and the change they have created around the world inspire the SSEC, and were incredibly glad to be a part of that process. Although this post details the development of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals guides from beginning to end, we know that sharing them with youth is just the beginning of everyone working together towards a sustainable future.",1004

5 Takeaways as a Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Intern
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/5-takeaways-smithsonian-science-global-goals-intern,"Just a few months ago, I was scouring the Internet as a high school senior, trying to find a way to spend my summer before starting my freshman year of college. I have always been drawn to the Smithsonian, from its thriving museums and centers that share ideas to the expansive network of researchers creating new knowledge. I knew I wanted to contribute to this amazing community before I left the greater Washington D.C. Area. I was thrilled to participate as a summer intern with the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC). Now that my internship is drawing to an end (sadly!) I have five takeaways I learned from my experience as a Smithsonian Science for Global Goals intern working on the Biotechnology! community research guide. Whether youre an aspiring SSEC intern, incoming college freshman, or anywhere in between, I hope this can be helpful. 1. Try something new. Exploring unexplored interests can be exciting yet nerve-wracking. Before SSEC, I had done work in STEM education, lab research, public speaking, and writing. But I had never really had an experience that tied my interdisciplinary interests together. In joining the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Team, I could simultaneously explore the field of STEM curriculum development while also diving into new topics like biotechnology in agriculture and the environment that I might have never thought to explore. My nervousness in this uncharted territory was alleviated by the fact that my life will probably only get busier from here on out; if not now, when? 2. Do your background research. Ever see something and go, Wow, I have no idea what this is? That was me pretty much every day during my internship! But only because I was discovering so much new information each day. I found that in order to translate high level material into the simplified language needed for student-facing materials, you must first become a high level expert yourself. Know that its okay if you dont know things now, but take notes and stockpile resources along the way. Youll thank yourself later! 3. Diverse teamwork makes the dream work. Diversity of backgrounds and ideas makes a concept stronger. While researching a part of the Biotechnology! guide on the environment, I had an unforgettable discussion with Smithsonian researcher and coral expert Dr. Mary Hagedorn. She used the example of diversity in humans as a tool to help students understand the importance of biodiversity in ecosystems. Differences in backgrounds and ideas make a society stronger, just like biodiversity makes an ecosystem stronger. A simple concept, sure, but its true! As I worked with other interns from around the United States and the globe, I got to hear perspectives that I had never heard before. This helped make my work more inclusive and thoughtful. I always walked away from each brainstorming session having gone a step further conceptually and learned something new. 4. Thinking takes time. Nevertheless, there will be a period where youre trying to find a clear path within all the wonderful ideas you have. Attending a staff Lesson Jam, which is a brainstorming session where all of SSEC comes together to hash out a specific idea, illustrated this process to me. For 30 minutes, a group of highly-educated adults talked about everything from the solubility of Kool-Aid to what scenario we should use for a math problem. Although we didnt pin down one idea at the end, Im confident that that conversation helped create the final product, and I had a lot of fun. Brainstorming can be a worthwhile challenge that you dont have to tackle on your own. 5. Enjoy the process! I will never forget the camaraderie that happened in between the lines during SSEC: diving into tangents on carbon sequestration and cloning in a one-on-one advisor meeting; bonding over high school life in an intern hangout after work; and fellow interns hyping each other up for our individual successes. While I may have had a lot going on this summer (working, moving, and the pre-frosh grind included) I always looked forward to anything SSEC related. Every connection I made has shaped me into someone who will continue to discover, understand, and act for a lifetime.",698

Adapting to Change: Benefits of Inquiry-Based Science Education for Students and Teachers
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/adapting-change-benefits-inquiry-based-science-education-students-and-teachers,"In October of 2019, the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) was awarded an early-phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR) grantfrom the U.S. Department of Education. We were excited to begin our project providing Smithsonian Science for the Classroom curriculum and professional development to teachers. How could we have predicted that mere months later a global pandemic would wreak havoc on classroom learning worldwide? When schools abruptly and indefinitely closed their doors in March 2020, our project bringing inquiry-based science curriculum to third, fourthand fifth-grade students in rural North and South Carolina was turned upside down, along with everything else. Our best-laid plans to understand howSmithsonian Science for the Classroomcurriculum and robust professional development (PD) impact student achievement in science, math, and reading suddenly seemed like a far-off dream. When we finally launched our first workshop in the spring of 2021, it was with renewed purpose to combat learning loss and build connections.  The PD we held in March 2021 was completely reimagined for our new normal of online convenings, and much different from the big kick-off in-person introduction we had planned. Teachers were, understandably, swamped trying to serve students who might be in the classroom one day and at home the next. Despite these challenges, weve seen teachers confidence in their science instruction grow over the past three years, first in the virtual environment and then when we resumed in-person PD. Does change like this happen overnight? Absolutely not! But just as our workshops have evolved to meet changing needs, so have teachers attitudes. By our last PD in summer 2023, we received positive feedback from teachers and participants in the program, WOW! I was so engaged in these PD lessons and feel more empowered to take on instruction on these new 4th grade science standards. At the start of our most recent Content and Pedagogy Professional Development, we asked teachers when they last took a chemistry or physics class. Some couldnt remember if they ever took one, while others mentioned a class 10+ years ago. Although there was some apprehension about not being subject-matter experts, teachers asked questions, shared their classroom knowledge and werent afraid to be vulnerable. During the workshop, teachers participated in activities and simulations to address misconceptions and explore different teaching strategies. By the end of our two days together, teachers felt energized and confident in themselves and their ability to guide learning alongside their students.  To better understand the effect on students, our third-party evaluator, the Center for Research in Educational Policy (CREP) at the University of Memphis, is currently analyzing student assessment data. We eagerly await a better understanding of the impact of Smithsonian Science for the Classroom curriculum and accompanying professional development on student achievement in science, math and reading. While were excited the preliminary analysis is very positive, the project has bolstered more than students scores. Weve seen teachers attitudes and confidence related to science learning and instruction bloom and directly translate to students excitement about science. The curriculum is very engaging to the students. They love the hands-on activities, they take leadership while working in groups, theyre pulled into discovery and the joy of the discovery when they do the experiments, said Andrea Walter from Polk Central Elementary School. They also enjoy the reading selections because it brings a global perspective to their lives and they make connections to what theyre learning in social studies. While the Smithsonian Science Education Center and our incredible collaborators might not have known what was in store when awarded the grant in 2019, we have made the most of the opportunity to serve teachers and students in rural districts across North and South Carolina. The fact that all 37 of the schools who first signed on to participate have remained in the project is a testament to their tenacity and resilience as much as it is the resources we have to offer. We look forward to sharing more with supporters after the official publication of the analysis and, until then, continue to showcase the holistic benefits of inquiry-based science education on student outcomes.",678

Professional Development in North and South Carolina, vol. 1
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/professional-development-north-and-south-carolina-vol-1,"The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) launched theSmithsonian Science for North and South Carolina Classroomsprogram in 2019 with a U.S. Department of Education early phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR)grant. Read the second installment in this blog serieshere. Designed to provide ongoing curriculum and professional development support to teachers, educators receive inquiry-based science training on Smithsonian Science for the Classroom modules to build their own confidence and subsequently that of their students in science, math, and reading. Over 150 third, fourth, and fifth grade science teachers in 7 school districts across the two states have been impacted through this program to date. Jennifer JJ Waddell is a science teacher at Polk Central Elementary School in North Carolina. While her school is now entering its third year of implementation, spring 2021 was the first opportunity for teachers to participate in professional development and receive curriculum. She received in-depth training on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom moduleHow Can We Provide Energy to Peoples Homes?during the spring 2021 professional development session. We spoke with JJ to learn more about her experiences throughout the professional development.  SSEC: How did you feel after finding out you were going to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for North Carolina and South Carolina program? Did you have any expectations? JJ:We were told by our curriculum instructional administrator that this was a really great program. We were excited and (still are) to do the professional development with the Smithsonian Science Education Center. Energy is such a big part of our curriculum in North Carolina for 4th grade, so it was really cool that something that we teach was made into something broader with the information that we were given through the Smithsonian. The books and additional material really go in-depth into energy, batteries, electricity, and all things that are important for energy. {The professional development allows them to have a deep dive of the lesson}. These are things that we would love to teach our kids, but we may not always have the opportunity to, whether its a time crunch or the way that the material was laid out. Its a good indicator of hey, we can get this done. We had a few teachers who had been through a similar program a few years ago, so we had a little bit of background of what to expect. Our administrators and those who had taken courses in the past from the Smithsonian thought they were great. It was really impactful to see how this was going to be useful in the classroom. What would you describe as the most impactful moment for you during your professional development? There was a really big lightbulb moment on day two that we realized all of the different lessons were connected intricately and built upon each other. It started at a primary level by using basic knowledge that kids were already coming to the table with, and then increased the knowledge base. You couldnt do lesson 3 without doing lesson 2 and I really enjoyed seeing that aspect. Oftentimes we have curriculum that diverges here and there, so we constantly feel like we have to do extra research or extra activities to fill in gaps. The [Smithsonian Science for the Classroom] had no gaps and went further in-depth of the knowledge base that the kids should already know. Even if the student didnt understand it the first time around, they were definitely going to on the second trytheres a constant spiraling review of the whole process that uses the same science content language.  In this screenshot from PD, JJ and others view the Carolina Science Online interface. In your experience, how has this curriculum differed from ones you might have taught in the past? Theres a lot of project-based learning that we went through with Smithsonian Science for the Classroom. It seemed like almost all of the lessons we went over included an experiment with reasoning and observations instead of just presenting information in a textbook. It provided resources and let the students investigate different approaches to science, which was really cool. How has this professional development challenged you to think differently about science education? Its easy for me, and I have to catch myselfnot to just give them the answer. Its really been eye opening for me to realize that the kids just need to use that deductive reasoning and that theyve got to do this on their own. Im quick to just give them hints to lead them in the right direction for time's sake, but Im realizing that so much of the lesson builds off the previous that if I didnt get it all in during a 45-minute session that theres always tomorrow. They really enjoy it, and it really challenges me too. What was it like for you to meet other teachers who were becoming acclimated to Smithsonian Science for the Classroom? It was great to have that collaboration and to see things that worked in different situations. We often had discussions about remote learners versus in-class learners and some of the strategies they were using.",850

Stories of Women of Color in STEM: Robin Kumoluyi
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/stories-women-color-stem-robin-kumoluyi,"Robin Kumoluyi dreamed of becoming a scientist long before she stepped into a laboratory. She grew up in New Jersey with a lot of curiosity. This curiosity about her environment sparked her interest in the world. She began to ask how the things around her worked. This inquisitive nature led her to do some of her first science experiments before she was a teenager. My neighbors had a lilac tree in their yard, and I kept smelling this wonderful aroma, Robin said. I decided it was a good idea to climb the fence, go into their yard, pick flowers, and try to figure out how to make water that smelled like those flowers. I traded dolls for a miniature microscope when I was about nine years old, Robin said. The microscope was a birthday present. She used it to explore the world around her. I wasnt interested in dolls, I was interested in the world, she explained. Robin began to learn about microbiology in high school. She had a mentor who worked in the field. Microbiologists study living organisms that are too small to be seen with the naked eye, like bacteria. Time spent in the lab with her mentor deepened her interest in science. Robin also became an avid reader. Being able to see a microbiologist who looked like me, an African-American, in real life, was fabulous, she said. Knowing someone like herself fueled Robin. She pursued biology at Rutgers University. She planned to become a doctor. Then Robin fell in love with her microbiology classes. She decided to shift her career interests to microbiology. Through her classes, she became fascinated by the process that uses microorganisms to make foods and medicines. Running her first PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test merged Robins course work and interests. PCR tests amplify pieces of DNA. They are used to study genetic material. Seeing something that you learn in school actually being applied in real life was fascinating to me, she said. These real-life uses inspired Robin to support peoples health through medicine. Robins grandmother struggled with diabetes. Seeing that inspired Robin to focus on developing quality and accessible medicine. She wanted to help people enjoy their lives. Robin is now the Vice President and Chief Quality Officer, Pharmaceuticals, at Johnson & Johnson. In her role, she makes sure that the medicine her team creates is safe and effective for patients to use.  For me, its more about caring about people than it is about medicine, she said. I found that this was a way to care about people and support them on lifes journey by giving them something that made them strong and well. Robins goal of helping others with their health grew during the COVID-19 pandemic. She became committed to tackling health care inequities. I was extremely moved and motivated by the level of health care disparities uncovered during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said. We always knew that health care disparities were there, but the pandemic really highlighted them to a point of unbelief. Robin and her team helped in delivering Johnson & Johnsons COVID-19 vaccine to patients around the world. She described the moment as a once-in-alifetime opportunity that will impact the world. Robin hopes to continue to develop quality medicines, fight health care inequities, and mentor young people who are interested in science.

My Personal Recommendations for Ways to Create an Inclusive Environment for Students With Disabilities by Yujia Ding  
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/my-personal-recommendations-ways-create-inclusive-environment-students-disabilities,"Creating an inclusive environment is something that I strive for. Not only do I work towards making sure my classroom is a safe place, but I also work to make sure that if any student wants to perform an experiment or participate in an activity, they can perform that activity as best they can. The following recommendations are based on personal observations and experiences as well as, suggestions Ive received from friends and students with disabilities. I offer them as a way to start to engage students with disabilities and create a more inclusive learning space: Ask your student what works for them instead of assuming. Each student is different and unique; and every individual that identifies with disabilities is different. Even if they both are visually impaired, for instance, their needs and accommodations are going to differ and as an educator, one should not assume. Rather, speak with the student. Ask the student what their needs are. Ask the student what works for them and what doesnt. Invite your student to participate in how accommodations in the IEP are implemented. The conversation of accommodations and accessibility is an ongoing one. The conversation doesnt stop with the first day of school IEP meeting. Even if you get the IEP at the beginning of the school year, ensure that you speak with the student to know what works for your subject and your classroom space. While each teacher receives the same accommodations list for a particular student, the way those accommodations are applied in a biology class versus an English class may not be the same. Make sure that the accommodations are serving the student to support their learning at the same level and rigor as the rest of the class, not to use the accommodations to make the assignment or task easier to accomplish. Allow every student a chance to participate in classroom activities. Dont assume that your student can or cannot do something because of their disability. Give everyone a chance. Let the students try and try again. I always tell my students that failure is not the end of the road. Failure or the word fail, means First Attempt In Learning. I always ensure my students know that they have chances to succeed. As the teacher in the room, I make sure that the students learn from each attempt and are constantly improving. Having a growth mindset not only helps my students with ensuring they are challenging themselves and gaining new skills, it also helps me as the educator learn what works for different needs and then be able to call on those experiences when helping a future student. Try new things. Be innovative. Dont live inside a box. If the standard or commonly accepted solution doesnt work for one student, keep working with them to find something that will work. Think creatively. Because I have a disability, I realize how important it is to recognize the person first, because it is not the only thing that defines me. I am an individual with a disability, not a disabled individual. That is why I always strive to hold my students to the same rigor and expectations regardless of the differences among them. I help them pursue their passions and if modifications are needed along the way to ensure equity, work together as a team to ensure that can happen.",561

Read theprevious installmentin this blog series here. Carmelina Livingston is a Lead Education Specialist atSolutions in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (STEM Centers SC)and formerly an elementary and informal educator. She has attended and facilitated professional development for third grade teachers in South Carolina on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom modulesHow Can We Protect Animals When Their Habitat Changes?in March and August 2021 andHow Can We Predict Patterns of Motion?in summer 2022. We spoke with Carmelina in 2021 after virtual professional development to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: Why is science education important to you? Carmelina: Well, its always been important to me. Its actually the backbone of everything I do! Science is an integral part of everyday living, such as weather and how we use weather, medicine, when earthquakes happen, getting food sources from agriculture, designing useful technology to assist in gathering data for us to have knowledge, but also have application in our world. This is essential for us to see the connection to science facts and theories and apply this information to everyday living. SSEC: What would you describe as your most memorable moment during the professional development sessions? Carmelina: The most memorable moments happened when teachers would learn new content and information and then demonstrate their understanding in creative and engaging ways. I love to see them have these moments of realization and how their passion after learning new information translates into their own instruction. SSEC:How has participating in and also leading professional development onSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacted your own practice? Carmelina:Its all about the connections to the joy of teaching and getting the chance to reflect with teachers on their classroom instruction by sharing ideas on strategies, assessment, student engagement, and supplemental resources that would complement instruction. I have gained so much by working together online with the teachers to explore scientific phenomenon and content and then putting it into practice by facilitating fun, engaging, inquiry, and standards-based lessons with students. In this screenshot from PD, Carmelina facilitates a conversation with teachers using padlet about the red-cockaded woodpecker. SSEC: What type of support does this give teachers as they go through these types of experiences? Carmelina:I really like that teachers not only learn about curricular resources that are standards-based, engaging, and inquiry-based, but they also get a chance to do the activities and learn from one other. The teachers that I worked with exchanged great ideas with other teachers about how to approach different lessons and were very receptive to learning from each other. SSEC: How do you seeSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacting the practice of South Carolina teachers? Carmelina: South Carolina teachers will benefit greatly by having these modules available in their classrooms because all investigations are standards-based and highly engaging. The lessons are also adaptable to both physical and virtual classroom settings and enable teachers and their students to investigate science phenomena together. SSEC: What are the benefits to students experiencingSmithsonian Science for the Classroommodules? Carmelina: Students will benefit greatly because teachers have practiced the lessons with their peers prior to using the module materials and resources. If teachers consistently experience the best practices in science instruction and have a chance to learn and reflect with their peer teachers, then you will see exemplary science instruction and student achievement in the classrooms.",586

Meet Hyoungsuk Jeon 
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/meet-hyoungsuk-jeon,"Hyoungsuk Jeon is an Inventor, Radio Technologies and Research Manager with Ofinno. His curiosity about problem solving and engineering started at a young age with the help of a toy car gifted by his grandfather. As his passions grew, he moved from South Korea to America to pursue more advanced academic and career opportunities that aligned with his goals. Hyoungsuk spoke with the Smithsonian Science Education Center about his engineering career journey.  What was your first memorable experience with STEM? When I was 6 years old, my grandfather gifted me a small toy car. He said it would be more interesting if we disassembled the toy and figured out a way to reconstruct it together. I was a small child at the time and didnt have a full understanding of what that meant. All of a sudden, my grandfather disassembled the toy. There were plastic pieces and springs everywhere, and I was curious about how he was going to rebuild the toy. When I look back on that experience, that was my first lesson in reverse engineering. I learned that if I deconstruct a device or a machine, I can understand how it works. My grandfather wanted to show me the methods of how everyday objects operate, so I took that influential experience with me as I grew older and began to examine the details of how other things work.  How were you able to nurture your interests throughout middle and high school? Art and math were major influences of my current career path. I really enjoyed still-life painting and drawing because you have to observe a subject in great detail. I may imagine the color and shape of something, but when I actually analyzed it thoroughly, those details were different. Those observation skills are beneficial because Im now able to view subjects in an objective way instead of subjective. I also enjoyed the problem-solving skills necessary to complete advanced math equations. I had a math workbook and solved all of the problems on my own one summer during middle school. Refining those observation and problem-solving skills were a great foundation for me in engineering.  How did your teachers, mentors, or family members help you pursue your interests? My parents let me explore different subjects and supported those interests by sending me to enrichment programs like art classes, for example. They didnt push me into pursuing one subject over another, they allowed me to navigate things as I grew. Another influential person was my best friend who passed away when he was 20 years old. We had been friends since we were 8 years old, and we started having philosophical conversations in our teenage years. I feel like my personality and character started to develop during that period. He was the type of person who supported and encouraged people deeply, and he encouraged me to go to engineering school.  At what point did you realize that you could turn your passions into a career? In electrical engineering there are a variety of specialties. I was interested in the theoretical part because it involved so many math equations. I fell in love with solving open issues, but they were time intensive. I had my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the time, but it wasnt enough for me to work on more advanced issues. I decided to move to America to pursue my masters, Ph.D, and postdoctoral program. In South Korea, there were many opportunities for me to become a pure researcher to solve mathematical problems. But in the United States, there are more requirements for a theoretical skillset. I wanted to see how the problems I solved influenced people and the world. I found a job that allowed me to cultivate that skillset here at Ofinno.  Did you encounter any barriers to pursuing your STEM goals? When I was 18, I felt like Id lost my way and began to question my career path. In my early 20s I eventually decided to pursue engineering. I was interested in the theoretical part of electrical engineering and wanted to have a more practical skill set and thats why I did my post-doc in America.  Is there anyone that currently inspires you to continue working in this particular field? My parents always inspire me. In South Korea, my parents experienced the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. They were born into a wealthy family, but after the war, all of their property was gone. Those were difficult times for my parents and they always told us about the circumstances they worked to overcome. I realized how incredibly smart my parents were to navigate ways to survive under such harsh conditions. Learning about their sacrifices always motivates me to work hard and overcome barriers.  Can you describe your career path that led you to work at Ofinno? After moving to America, my first job was as an engineer and I worked to resolve wireless communication problems. It was a fun job for me and allowed me to gain more practical experience in my career. I wanted to have more collaboration and communication with colleagues in upper management teams. That motivated me to find a smaller company so that I could have more influence within the production process. Ofinno was a good fit for me because it allowed me to have an impact. Im able to be involved from the beginning to the end of an inventions project management, including working with attorneys to have the invention patented.  ",914

A Sign of Apocalypse
",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/sign-apocalypse,"Throughout mankinds history we have looked to the sky for inspiration, navigation, and guidance in understanding our world. Astronomical phenomena have influenced our creation myths and religions. The magnificent display of a lunar eclipse has impacted cultures and inspired fear throughout mankind's past. The lunar eclipse is one of the most documented astronomical occurrences in history. For thousands of years, civilizations have been observing its red glow and attributing meaning to the sight. Many feared that the lunar eclipse was an omen of evil or an indication that tragic events were on the horizon. The Ancient Mesopotamians, one of the early cultures to study astronomy and track the movements of celestial objects, believed that during the lunar eclipse, the Moon was being attacked by demons. Their astronomical observations and recordings were advanced enough that they could predict when a lunar eclipse would occur. In 1502 Christopher Columbus and his men were stranded in Jamaica and had been surviving with help from the native Tano people. However, the natives grew increasingly impatient with the European squatters beginning to refuse aid and supplies to Columbus and his men. Columbus used information from an almanac of astronomical tables, which informed him of the occurrence of a total lunar eclipse within a few days. He told the natives that if they did not continue giving him food and supplies his god would inflame the Moon with his wrath as a sign of future punishment. As predicted the lunar eclipse followed. Terrified by the blood-colored Moon they acquiesced to Columbus demands. Lunar eclipses have also aided in furthering our understanding of our universe. The Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos, known for proposing the first Helio-Centric (sun-centered) model of the solar system made great strides in the field of astronomy. He famously used the occurrence of a lunar eclipse and his understanding of mathematics to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. By using a known size of the Earth and measuring the duration of the lunar eclipse, he was able to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. While relatively inaccurate, he was the first to ever do this calculation. While for most people the lunar eclipse no longer signifies the coming of an apocalyptic event, the mystique surrounding the infamous Blood Moon holds to this day. The lunar eclipse is in fact not mystical at all; it is quite simply the Earth passing in between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. As the Moon begins to be shadowed from part of the Sun's light, the Moon will appear to dim (see Figure 1). This is when the Moon passes into an area called the penumbra, the part of the shadow where the entirety of the Moon is still illuminated by the Sunlight, however part of the Sunlight is blocked by the Earth causing the drop in brightness. When just this happens it is called a penumbral eclipse and this accounts for most lunar eclipses. On even rarer occasions, the Moon will then begin to disappear into the night sky. This occurs as the Moon passes into the umbra, where all direct sunlight is blocked casting a dark shadow on the Moon. The Moon will fully disappear entering what is called totality. Then the lunar eclipse shows its true colors. Ethan GevinsonFigure 1. Parts of a lunar eclipse. Image not to scale. Even when the Moon is entirely in the umbral shadow, some light manages to reach the Moon by passing around the Earth, through the atmosphere. This causes a change in color due to a principle called Rayleigh scattering, and this is the same principle that gives the sky its blue color. This principle states that when light passes through a medium such as the atmosphere, shorter wavelength of light is scattered more. What we end up seeing is that light towards the blue end of the spectrum is scattered more than red light since blue light has a shorter wavelength (e.g. Figure 2). This gives the effect of different colors of light being refracted at different angles similar to light passing through a prism. Ethan GevinsonFigure 2. Bluer light has a shorter wavelength and redder light has a longer wavelength. This is also why sunrises and sunsets appear red. As the Sun appears to set on the horizon, the sunlight passes through the longer path of Earths atmosphere to reach your eyes than when it appears high in the sky. The blue light is scattered away while the red light could reach us. Interestingly, when we are looking at a lunar eclipse, the red light projected onto the Moon is the light of sunrises and sunsets that we see on Earth (Figure 3). So if you manage to see a blood Moon, you can consider yourself lucky, as you are seeing the light from all of the sunsets and sunrises from around the world being projected onto the Moon. Ethan GevinsonFigure 3. The light from the Sun being scattered by the atmosphere, giving the Moon its red color. When is the next lunar eclipse? On May 5th, 2023 between 15:15 and 19:32 UTC the Moon will pass into the Penumbra creating a nearly total penumbral eclipse visible from most of Europe, Africa, and Asia (Figure 5). This type of eclipse unfortunately will not result in the iconic Blood Moon, just simply a dimming of the Moon with darker shading on one side. Whether you are able to see the upcoming eclipse or will be holding out until the next total lunar eclipse in March of 2025 it is an impressive sight to behold. People have always looked to the skies for answers and have learned from events like the lunar eclipse. To join them all you need to do is look it up. Ethan GevinsonFigure 4.
