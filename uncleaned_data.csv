2024-04-27 21:14:45,Disease_Symptoms,The Vitamin D Deficiency Test: How Can You Find Out If You Are Deficient?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/vitamin-d-deficiency-test/,"One of the common deficiencies that most people are suffering from is Vitamin D deficiency. Doctors are recommending avitamin d deficiency testto find out where you currently stand. This form of deficiency will cause issues with your muscle and bones. It affects people over the age of 65 mostly and those with darker skin tones. But, with proper advice and a doctor’s help, this deficiency is easily treatable. More on vitamin D deficiency: As the name suggests, vitamin D deficiency actually means your body is not having the right level of vitamin D it deserves. Most of you might want to knowwhat is vitamin d test. Well, this test helps you to know the level of vitamin D your body has and if it is running towards a deficiency level. With a lesser vitamin D count, your bones will start to feel weak, along with your muscles. Vitamin D is one prime vitamin that the body uses for normal bone development and proper maintenance. It even plays a major role in the immune system, musculoskeletal system, and nervous system. There are different ways in which your body can get the right amount ofvitamin d levels in bloodas it needs. The first and foremost option is through UV rays. But, people who are older and those with darker skin might not get the right amount of Vitamin D through sunlight. Furthermore, your geographical location will also determine the amount of sunlight your body can get. The next stop is the foods that you eat, through which you will receive the much-needed Vitamin D. There are some nutritional supplements recommended by doctors once you have done through propervitamin d deficiency test, only if your body needs it. The importance that comes with Vitamin D: Your body seriously needs an appropriate amount of Vitamin D to stay fit and healthy. It plays a major role to maintain a proper balance of calcium within your bloodstream and bones and also to maintain it. Specifically, you need proper Vitamin D so that your body can use phosphorus and calcium to build strong bones and also support healthy tissues. Understandwhat is vitamin d testbefore you plan to get one. It will let you know if you are suffering from chronic Vitamin D deficiency. With a chronic deficiency level, there will be a decrease in phosphorus and calcium absorption within your intestines. It can lead to hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency can also causehyperparathyroidism, where the overactive parathyroid gland will try to keep blood calcium levels normal. Both these issues can get severe if your Vitamin D deficiency is not treated on time and can cause some serious symptoms likefatigue, depression, muscle weakness, and cramps. For balancing the calcium levels within your blood, your body will take calcium from bones. It can eventually lead to accelerating bone demineralization. If not treated on time, this situation will result in osteomalacia in adults. Children can suffer from rickets. Osteoporosis and rickets can increase the chances of bone fractures. As a child’s bone is still at its growing stage, demineralization will cause bent or bowed bones. If you want to prevent these issues from hampering your life, then managing propervitamin d levels in bloodis the main clue to consider over here. Who will get highly affected by Vitamin D deficiency? Anyone can be a victim of vitamin D deficiency. So, doctors are always recommending patients move on with avitamin d deficiency testnow. Not just adults, but children and even infants might suffer from the high-end deficiency level right now. This form of deficiency is highly common among people with higher skin melanin content or darker skin. It is also common among those people who tend to wear clothes with high-end skin coverage. Right now, vitamin D deficiency has become a common global phenomenon. Around 1 billion people, worldwide, are suffering from this issue. Around 50% of the world’s population has insufficient vitamin D consumed by their bodies. In the USA, around 35% of adults are victims of vitamin D deficiency nowadays. So, getting proper treatment has become a necessity these days. The signs and symptoms: It is true that you have your answer onwhat is vitamin d test. It shows if you are one of those people suffering from vitamin D deficiency or not. But, even if you don’t take the test before, there are some signs that will help you to know if you might be one such victim. Let’s learn about those symptoms now. Children can suffer from rickets due to vitamin D deficiency. Some of those symptoms among kids are muscle weakness, incorrect growth patterns, pain in the bone, and joint deformities. Children who are suffering from mild deficiency levels might feel weak and sore muscles or painful muscle tissues. Adults will feel fatigued and have bone pain as well if they have lowervitamin d levels in blood. Other than muscle cramps and weakness, some other symptoms of vitamin D deficiency will be mood changes like depression. However, it is not always common to have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Some people may not face any of the issues mentioned above, but still, end up being a victim of deficiency. That’s why the vitamin D test is vital for all. More about the vitamin D deficiency test: Generally speaking, there are different types of vitamin D deficiency tests available. It is widely used for screening lower levels of vitamin D in your blood. So, you can get the treatment going ASAP with supplements before the deficiency level can cause some serious health problems.

His journey from Malm FF to AC Milan has been one of the greatest. Scoring over 500 club goals, he has been giving pleasure to millions of football fans across the globe for more than two decades. His goals have been mind blowing! The strategy, the movement and the execution is unimaginable. Widely known for his bicycle goals, the karate kicking goals and his dribbling skills, he is literally one of the worlds finest players. Well known for his savage comments and comebacks in football, Zlatan never fails to disappoint the media. One such incident was when Cristiano Ronaldo scored a beautiful bicycle kick from Real Madrid against Juventus in 2018 Champions League. Referring to this goal, one interviewer asked Zlatan, Cristiano Ronaldo scored today, how would you describe that? And who is a better goal scorer, you (Zlatan) or Ronaldo? Zlatan replied with, He (Cr7) scored a beautiful goal today but he should try it from 40 meters. The interviewer roared with laughter and this caught attention of the fans and media pretty quick. Zlatan was referring to his bicycle kick goal against England which he scored from 40m. A sensational goal it was, contributing to his memorable career. Zlatans amazing goal from Ajax against NAC football club has gone down in history books. He dribbled past 5 opponent players and the goal keeper, leaving them all confused. And the list of goals and assists go on and on. Once in an interview, he was asked which superpower would he like to possess and he replied, I already have them. Media, yet again got a Classic Zlatan answer. The 41 year old had shared a great bond with Lionel Messi, having played with him in Barcelona during 2009-11. Zlatan was always ready to stand up for his Argentinian friend, preferring him in award shows and interviews. Zlatan was given a grand farewell by AC Milan. The striker announced to AC Milan fans that he will he will retire after they played their final game of the season against Hellas Verona on Sunday. Ibrahimovic was in tears in front of the San Siro crowd as he bid farewell to the club and called time on his glittering career. He has been one of the most magnificent player of this football era. The little kids who had just started being fond of football because of him to the old ones who enjoyed seeing him play, shed tears during Zlatans retirement speech. This retirement was enough to make an old man cry. Zlatan retiring from football is an end of a powerful era. Having contributed so much to football, all fans gave him a big thanks. He has surely blessed our eyes by his career. However, during his speech, he was interrupted by loud booing by the fans of Verona. Zlatan fired back the perfect response saying, Keep booing. This is the biggest moment in your year seeing me. Its only true that, Lions, they dont compare themselves with humans.- Zlatan Ibrahimovic",525

That’s whyregular checkupsfor most people are essential to good health. Your eyes, ears, heart, and many other parts of your body need to be checked regularly to ensure nothing is developing in a problematic way. Regular health checkupsare a great way to keep your body in good condition and ensure you stay healthy throughout your life. You may not think much about your health, but regular checkups are essential to any medical treatment plan. Here are some of the mainadvantages of having regular health checkups. Advantages of Regular Full Health Check ups It helps you keep track of your health status and helps you stay on top of any changes in your body. It allows your doctor to monitor your medications and make changes if needed, ensuring that they’re working as they should be. Improvement in overall health status is possible. In addition to catching common illnesses such as colds and the flu, regular checkups can detect other diseases that are easier to spot in day-to-day activities (e.g., high blood pressure). It is essential to know that the earlier a disease is detected, the better your chances are of getting better. By having regular checkups, you can prevent the onset of diseases that could potentially threaten your life in the future. It’s easier to treat an illness when it’s still in its early stages.

Not only do I work towards making sure my classroom is a safe place, but I also work to make sure that if any student wants to perform an experiment or participate in an activity, they can perform that activity as best they can. The following recommendations are based on personal observations and experiences as well as, suggestions Ive received from friends and students with disabilities. I offer them as a way to start to engage students with disabilities and create a more inclusive learning space: Ask your student what works for them instead of assuming. Each student is different and unique; and every individual that identifies with disabilities is different. Even if they both are visually impaired, for instance, their needs and accommodations are going to differ and as an educator, one should not assume. Rather, speak with the student. Ask the student what their needs are. Ask the student what works for them and what doesnt. Invite your student to participate in how accommodations in the IEP are implemented. The conversation of accommodations and accessibility is an ongoing one. The conversation doesnt stop with the first day of school IEP meeting. Even if you get the IEP at the beginning of the school year, ensure that you speak with the student to know what works for your subject and your classroom space. While each teacher receives the same accommodations list for a particular student, the way those accommodations are applied in a biology class versus an English class may not be the same. Make sure that the accommodations are serving the student to support their learning at the same level and rigor as the rest of the class, not to use the accommodations to make the assignment or task easier to accomplish. Allow every student a chance to participate in classroom activities. Dont assume that your student can or cannot do something because of their disability. Give everyone a chance. Let the students try and try again. I always tell my students that failure is not the end of the road. Failure or the word fail, means First Attempt In Learning. I always ensure my students know that they have chances to succeed. As the teacher in the room, I make sure that the students learn from each attempt and are constantly improving. Having a growth mindset not only helps my students with ensuring they are challenging themselves and gaining new skills, it also helps me as the educator learn what works for different needs and then be able to call on those experiences when helping a future student. Try new things. Be innovative. Dont live inside a box. If the standard or commonly accepted solution doesnt work for one student, keep working with them to find something that will work. Think creatively. Because I have a disability, I realize how important it is to recognize the person first, because it is not the only thing that defines me. I am an individual with a disability, not a disabled individual. That is why I always strive to hold my students to the same rigor and expectations regardless of the differences among them. I help them pursue their passions and if modifications are needed along the way to ensure equity, work together as a team to ensure that can happen.",561
2024-04-27 21:38:11,sports,Unending saga of smashing racquets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/legalperspectives/unending-saga-of-smashing-racquets-54954/,"Tennis is usually considered the gentlemans sport and of course why not? It is indeed an individual sport requiring great strength and endurance. But certain acts dont do justice to such labels. Tennis players are seen smashing their racquets in a fit of rage. Considering the other side of the coin it might not seem all wrong as there is immense pressure players are in and sometimes such rage acts make them cool down but should this be supported or appreciated? Smashing racquets is legally prohibited by the rules of tennis and is considered very unsportsmanlike having huge penalties and fines associated with it. A large number of players chose this violation each year. The racquet abuse rule includes intentionally and violently destroying rackets, and equipment or hitting the net and umpires chair. This can attract fines ranging from $500  $2500 per violation and many times even a point penalty, game penalty, or getting defaulted in extreme cases. It is a violation of the code of conduct, there is a risk of injury, damage, and negative impact on the game and everyone. Maybe the players can afford to lose racquets in such a way, but this should not be promoted. Videos can be easily found in YouTube titles such as Most epic racquet smashes. The dilemma is, what is epic in this? In cricket, when it rains, the cricketers try to protect their bat first before themselves, in many cultures whenever a foundation is laid for a building the equipment is first worshipped, even in wars the weapons were worshipped before going into the battlefield. These are means of your livelihood and should be respected. Talking about tennis, the racquet is all the means because of which the players are playing in that position, earning money, income, feeding the family, and they have all they want because of it. Young children look up to these players aspiring to be like them one day, and such furious actions do make them frown. And it also comes as a surprise that it seems strange to see these players gaining too much success and experience, to react in this way. And by smashing the racquets they prioritize it over actually winning the game. These reactions are also welcomed with boo from the audience.  Nick Kyrios is the player who has one of the most racquets smashes and has probably paid a lot of fines as well. Novak Djokovic showed disappointing behavior by smashing racquets, screaming, hitting the net, and even throwing his racquet into the audience in the auspicious 2020 Olympics. This type of activity not only disrespects the sport, but also the racquet, the court, the audience, and the fans. The Olympics is such a big organization and people work day and night to get to represent their country in it. Djokovic displaying this behavior was embarrassing. Rafael Nadal condoned his demeanor and was thankful as there was no one sitting in the stands. Winning and losing are part and parcel of any game, especially in tennis where there are no draws. Racquet abuse is a way to promote unacceptance of loss which is not something any sport is meant for setting poor examples for others. Hence, there could be more constructive ways to manage emotions in court thereby ending the saga of smashing racquets.",554

Their related infections have grown big times in recent years. A mosquito that carries the virus will pass it down to a human by biting him. When another mosquito bites an infected person, it picks up the disease and will pass it on to the next person it bites. We believe it to be one of the majorcauses ofdengue fever.

2024-04-27 22:34:06,science_education,A Sign of Apocalypse,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/sign-apocalypse,"Throughout mankinds history we have looked to the sky for inspiration, navigation, and guidance in understanding our world. Astronomical phenomena have influenced our creation myths and religions. The magnificent display of a lunar eclipse has impacted cultures and inspired fear throughout mankind's past. The lunar eclipse is one of the most documented astronomical occurrences in history. For thousands of years, civilizations have been observing its red glow and attributing meaning to the sight. Many feared that the lunar eclipse was an omen of evil or an indication that tragic events were on the horizon. The Ancient Mesopotamians, one of the early cultures to study astronomy and track the movements of celestial objects, believed that during the lunar eclipse, the Moon was being attacked by demons. Their astronomical observations and recordings were advanced enough that they could predict when a lunar eclipse would occur. In 1502 Christopher Columbus and his men were stranded in Jamaica and had been surviving with help from the native Tano people. However, the natives grew increasingly impatient with the European squatters beginning to refuse aid and supplies to Columbus and his men. Columbus used information from an almanac of astronomical tables, which informed him of the occurrence of a total lunar eclipse within a few days. He told the natives that if they did not continue giving him food and supplies his god would inflame the Moon with his wrath as a sign of future punishment. As predicted the lunar eclipse followed. Terrified by the blood-colored Moon they acquiesced to Columbus demands. Lunar eclipses have also aided in furthering our understanding of our universe. The Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos, known for proposing the first Helio-Centric (sun-centered) model of the solar system made great strides in the field of astronomy. He famously used the occurrence of a lunar eclipse and his understanding of mathematics to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. By using a known size of the Earth and measuring the duration of the lunar eclipse, he was able to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. While relatively inaccurate, he was the first to ever do this calculation. While for most people the lunar eclipse no longer signifies the coming of an apocalyptic event, the mystique surrounding the infamous Blood Moon holds to this day. The lunar eclipse is in fact not mystical at all; it is quite simply the Earth passing in between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. As the Moon begins to be shadowed from part of the Sun's light, the Moon will appear to dim (see Figure 1). This is when the Moon passes into an area called the penumbra, the part of the shadow where the entirety of the Moon is still illuminated by the Sunlight, however part of the Sunlight is blocked by the Earth causing the drop in brightness. When just this happens it is called a penumbral eclipse and this accounts for most lunar eclipses. On even rarer occasions, the Moon will then begin to disappear into the night sky. This occurs as the Moon passes into the umbra, where all direct sunlight is blocked casting a dark shadow on the Moon. The Moon will fully disappear entering what is called totality. Then the lunar eclipse shows its true colors. Ethan GevinsonFigure 1. Parts of a lunar eclipse. Image not to scale. Even when the Moon is entirely in the umbral shadow, some light manages to reach the Moon by passing around the Earth, through the atmosphere. This causes a change in color due to a principle called Rayleigh scattering, and this is the same principle that gives the sky its blue color. This principle states that when light passes through a medium such as the atmosphere, shorter wavelength of light is scattered more. What we end up seeing is that light towards the blue end of the spectrum is scattered more than red light since blue light has a shorter wavelength (e.g. Figure 2). This gives the effect of different colors of light being refracted at different angles similar to light passing through a prism. Ethan GevinsonFigure 2. Bluer light has a shorter wavelength and redder light has a longer wavelength. This is also why sunrises and sunsets appear red. As the Sun appears to set on the horizon, the sunlight passes through the longer path of Earths atmosphere to reach your eyes than when it appears high in the sky. The blue light is scattered away while the red light could reach us. Interestingly, when we are looking at a lunar eclipse, the red light projected onto the Moon is the light of sunrises and sunsets that we see on Earth (Figure 3). So if you manage to see a blood Moon, you can consider yourself lucky, as you are seeing the light from all of the sunsets and sunrises from around the world being projected onto the Moon. Ethan GevinsonFigure 3. The light from the Sun being scattered by the atmosphere, giving the Moon its red color. When is the next lunar eclipse? On May 5th, 2023 between 15:15 and 19:32 UTC the Moon will pass into the Penumbra creating a nearly total penumbral eclipse visible from most of Europe, Africa, and Asia (Figure 5). This type of eclipse unfortunately will not result in the iconic Blood Moon, just simply a dimming of the Moon with darker shading on one side. Whether you are able to see the upcoming eclipse or will be holding out until the next total lunar eclipse in March of 2025 it is an impressive sight to behold. People have always looked to the skies for answers and have learned from events like the lunar eclipse. To join them all you need to do is look it up. Ethan GevinsonFigure 4.

2024-04-27 21:14:48,Disease_Symptoms,8 Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/8-signs-and-symptoms-of-hypothyroidism/,"Also known as underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a major condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough crucial hormones. There are differentsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidismto notify, in order to get a quality medical response faster. Hypothyroidism might not always offer noticeable symptoms at the early stages, but with time, untreated hypothyroidism will cause serious health issues like infertility, joint pain, obesity, and heart issues. So, proper thyroid tests are essential to perform once you have covered the basicsigns of hypothyroidism. It helps in diagnosing the issue and getting quality results accordingly. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is a pretty simple, effective, and safe one, once you have coveredthyroid infection symptomsquickly and your doctor came across the right dose to use. 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism: Searching the vast world of the internet will not just let you learn about thehypothyroidism effectsbut also provides some surprisingsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism. It is vital to learn about the 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism so that you can get medical attention faster. One of the majorsigns of hypothyroidism, depression will offer mental instability that you want to avoid from the get-go. It is true that hypothyroidism causes the brain to slow down a bit. So, that makes it difficult for the patients to focus, resulting in clinical depression. Most people underestimate the depression level caused by hypothyroidism these days. Whenever you compromise your mood, you will start feeling stiff and weak. These are some of the basicthyroid infection symptomsto watch out for. Unexpected weight gain is another one of the probablehypothyroidism effectson your body. The low-thyroid individuals are signaling their muscles, liver, and even fat tissues to hold onto calories. Whenever your thyroid levels are low, the metabolism will switch modes. So, in place of burning calories for activity and growth, the basal metabolic rate will start to decrease. Therefore, the body starts to store more calories from diet much like fat. Gaining weight seems to be a pretty obvious sign due to such conditions. Even though hypothyroidism can cause some serious issues with memory jogging, some research and scientific notes have proved that it won’t lead to any permanent cognitive dysfunction. So, even though you might face some memory problems, it is only for a limited time span. With proper medications from doctors, you can ward off your memory problems with ease. While looking forsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism, feeling cold seems to be at the top of the list. Heat is mainly the byproduct of burning calories. As your body isn’t burning enough calories during hypothyroidism, you will always feel cold. With hypothyroidism, your BMR is going to decrease, and that reduces the amount of heat that you get to generate. Along with that, the thyroid hormone turns up the thermostat on brown fat that generates more heat. Such brown heat is mandatory for maintaining heat during cold climates. But, hypothyroidism will prevent such fat from doing its job. Lower thyroid hormones will flip the metabolic switch towards that of catabolism. That’s when the body starts to break down the tissues like muscles for energy. During this catabolism period, muscle strength starts to decrease, leading to weakness. This process of breaking down the muscle tissue will cause aching. So, aching in muscles and joints will be another one of the majorsigns of hypothyroidismto follow. Even though everyone feels weak at least once, hypothyroidism people are likely to feel it twice! Much like most cells, the hair follicles are promisingly regulated by none other than the thyroid hormone. As these follicles are noted to have stem cells with a shorter lifespan and higher turnover round, they are likely to be more sensitive to lower thyroid levels than any other tissue. The lower thyroid will cause these follicles to stop regenerating and that gives rise to hair loss. It can be improved when you can treat the thyroid problem from its core. So, if you are suffering from unwanted hair loss, it is one of the majorthyroid infection symptomsto consider. Recent studies have shown that around 25 to 30% of patients, who are suffering from hair loss, were proven to be suffering from hypothyroidism. Skin cells are further characterized by rapid turnover, much like hair follicles. So, they are pretty sensitive to losing the growth signals from that thyroid hormone. If the normal skin renewal cycle gets broken, it takes more time for the skin to re-grow. So, the outer skin layer has been accumulating damage for a long time. The dead skin, at this time, will take a longer time to shed, resulting in dry skin. Some studies have shown that around 74% of low thyroid patients are suffering from a flaky skin condition. So, it is one of the majorhypothyroidism effectsthat your body faces. Other interesting studies have proven that around 50% of patients with normal thyroid levels have stated to suffer from dry skin for other reasons. Recent studies have shown that 50% of people suffering from hypothyroidism have stated that their skin condition has gotten worse within a year of getting affected. So, if you are one of those unfortunate victims of dry skin, check for your thyroid level right away! Lower thyroid levels surely know how to put some brakes on the colon. Constipation will affect around 17% of those people suffering from hypothyroidism. Around 20% of people with hypothyroidism have stated that their constipation has gotten worse with time. Even though it is a common complaint among patients, it is uncommon for constipation to be the most severe symptom around here. Get proper diagnostics from Remedies Labs: The signs, mentioned above, will help you to clearly decipher if you are suffering from hypothyroidism or not. In case you are facing some serious issues and need help, call the team fromRemedies Labsto the rescue. Get your thyroid diagnosed to start proper medications immediately.

2024-04-27 22:34:13,science_education,Stories of Women of Color in STEM: Robin Kumoluyi,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/stories-women-color-stem-robin-kumoluyi,"Robin Kumoluyi dreamed of becoming a scientist long before she stepped into a laboratory. She grew up in New Jersey with a lot of curiosity. This curiosity about her environment sparked her interest in the world. She began to ask how the things around her worked. This inquisitive nature led her to do some of her first science experiments before she was a teenager. My neighbors had a lilac tree in their yard, and I kept smelling this wonderful aroma, Robin said. I decided it was a good idea to climb the fence, go into their yard, pick flowers, and try to figure out how to make water that smelled like those flowers. I traded dolls for a miniature microscope when I was about nine years old, Robin said. The microscope was a birthday present. She used it to explore the world around her. I wasnt interested in dolls, I was interested in the world, she explained. Robin began to learn about microbiology in high school. She had a mentor who worked in the field. Microbiologists study living organisms that are too small to be seen with the naked eye, like bacteria. Time spent in the lab with her mentor deepened her interest in science. Robin also became an avid reader. Being able to see a microbiologist who looked like me, an African-American, in real life, was fabulous, she said. Knowing someone like herself fueled Robin. She pursued biology at Rutgers University. She planned to become a doctor. Then Robin fell in love with her microbiology classes. She decided to shift her career interests to microbiology. Through her classes, she became fascinated by the process that uses microorganisms to make foods and medicines. Running her first PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test merged Robins course work and interests. PCR tests amplify pieces of DNA. They are used to study genetic material. Seeing something that you learn in school actually being applied in real life was fascinating to me, she said. These real-life uses inspired Robin to support peoples health through medicine. Robins grandmother struggled with diabetes. Seeing that inspired Robin to focus on developing quality and accessible medicine. She wanted to help people enjoy their lives. Robin is now the Vice President and Chief Quality Officer, Pharmaceuticals, at Johnson & Johnson. In her role, she makes sure that the medicine her team creates is safe and effective for patients to use.  For me, its more about caring about people than it is about medicine, she said. I found that this was a way to care about people and support them on lifes journey by giving them something that made them strong and well. Robins goal of helping others with their health grew during the COVID-19 pandemic. She became committed to tackling health care inequities. I was extremely moved and motivated by the level of health care disparities uncovered during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said. We always knew that health care disparities were there, but the pandemic really highlighted them to a point of unbelief. Robin and her team helped in delivering Johnson & Johnsons COVID-19 vaccine to patients around the world. She described the moment as a once-in-alifetime opportunity that will impact the world. Robin hopes to continue to develop quality medicines, fight health care inequities, and mentor young people who are interested in science.

2024-04-27 21:38:30,sports,WTC loss to Australia brings back memories of 2003 WC final for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/cricket-corner/wtc-loss-to-australia-brings-back-memories-of-2003-wc-final-for-india-55107/,"Ankit Kumar Singh Australias emasculation of India in the World Test Championship (WTC) final at The Oval on Sunday felt like a dj vu of the 2003 ODI World Cup finale when the two cricketing powerhouses had last met in the final of an ICC event. Ever since the inaugural ODI World Cup was played in England 52 years ago, there have been 22 ICC tournaments so far (12 ODI World Cups, 8 ICC Champions Trophies, 2 WTCs). However, only on two occasions, India and Australia have clashed in the final with the men from Down Under emerging triumphant on both occasions. The first of these occasions materialized at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg 20 years ago when the two sides battled it out for the ODI WC crown. The recently concluded WTC final marked the second encounter between the two proud nations. There are some uncanny similarities between the two finals which took place in two different decades. On both occasions, an Indian captain won the toss and chose to field first only to see the opposition batters send his bowlers on a leather hunt. Also, a pair of Australian batters took the game away from India in each of these two games that was played at a neutral venue. In 2003 it was Sourav Ganguly who won the toss and opted to bowl first. The decision clearly backfired as Australia went on to amass a mammoth 359/2 in 50 overs on the back of a sterling hundred from Ricky Ponting (121-ball 140) and an elegant 84-ball 88 from Damien Martyn. In reply, India were bowled out for 234 to hand over the WC title to the Australians. Cut to the 2023 WTC final at The Oval and a similar script unfolded on Day One with Rohit Sharma sending Australia in after winning the spin of the coin. After India had Australia reeling at 76/3, two opposition batters  Travis Head (163, 174 balls) and Steve Smith (121, 268 balls)  turned the game on its head with a partnership of 285 runs for the fourth wicket. Riding on their magnificent tons, Australia posted a huge first-innings total of 469 which set up their 209-run decimation of India in the end. REVENGE OF THE AUSSIES For Australia, the WTC triumph also marked the end of a six-year jinx featuring their Test battles with India. Since 2017, they had lost four back-to-back Test series against India with two of these defeats coming in home conditions. One of these series included the four matches played in 2020-21 when India were skittled for 36 in the second innings of the first Test in Adelaide before making a comeback for the ages to trample the hosts in Melbourne, pull off a draw in Sydney and then breach the seemingly impregnable Gabba despite missing the services of several key players to register a historic 2-1 win. India were also the only team to have beaten Australia in the current WTC cycle that began in 2021. Out of the six series they played during this period, they won five of them including victories over England (4-0), South Africa (2-0) and the West Indies (2-0) at home, and a memorable 1-0 win in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, they had to share the spoils 1-1 while in India, they suffered a 2-1 defeat. In the WTC final, though, Australia were the better side of the two by miles. They outshone India with both bat and ball to take home their 9th ICC silverware, a record no other country is even close to emulating. India and the West Indies (five each) are jointly second on the list of teams with most number of ICC trophies. Advance Australia Fair.",621

2024-04-27 22:34:15,science_education,"Professional Development in North and South Carolina, vol. 2",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/professional-development-north-and-south-carolina-vol-2,"The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) launched theSmithsonian Science for North and South Carolina Classroomsprogram in 2019 with a U.S. Department of Education early phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR)grant. Read the first installment in this blog serieshere. Donna Godley is a fifth grade science teacher at Tryon Elementary School in North Carolina and her school's site coordinator, responsible for supporting her fellow teachers and communicating with the other key players in the program. In March and August 2021, she attended professional development on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom moduleHow Can We Provide Freshwater to Those in Need?in preparation for implementing it with her students. We spoke with Donna to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: How did you feel when you learned you were going to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for North Carolina and South Carolina program? Did you have any expectations? Donna:Our Superintendent signed our school up and was looking for teachers to be a part of the program. I teach 5th grade science and were departmentalized. So after I volunteered, I also became a coordinator for my school. I worked with some of the Smithsonian Science units before and traveled to D.C. with other teachers for Smithsonian-related things several years ago. The quality of the Smithsonian programs are usually pretty good, so I felt like the effort I would be putting into it would be worth it for my students. What was your experience with the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom module you covered during the professional development? What was your experience going through the curriculum during the professional development? My unit was an [Engineering] design unit, and its about moving water from one area to another. The people that weve worked with anytime weve done the training have been great. Its been virtual, of course, because of COVID but the instructors have always been really good. The written materials, especially the teacher manual, is always so self explanatory because it covers everything in great detail. You can watch the videos if you have questions on anything. The teacher materials and the resources the Smithsonian Science Education Center provides are exceptional. Actually sitting through the material makes me more familiar with it, and I could teach the lessons without professional development because the materials are so high quality.  In this screenshot from PD, Donna describes her group's rationale for sorting images of landforms in a jamboard. What was it like for you to work with other teachers and coordinators during the training? It was great to receive feedback from others. I worked with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers from my school to help them figure out how they were going to teach the lessons. At the end of each year we hold a debrief to discuss highlights and how were going to work through certain challenges and implement them for the following school year. What has this experience been like for your students? The kids have loved it. With all of the hands-on activities, they say oh, were really scientists! It was so exciting for them to see crates of new materials they were going to work with. They really enjoy doing the design units because they had the opportunity to be creative and use the materials how they liked. Usually when Im doing things in my classroom, theres not a wealth of material to use and were limited to what Ive purchased. Everyone was very engaged because they were so enthralled with everything they were getting to use. They really enjoy being creative and it has really helped them with teamwork. In 5th grade, getting along and working together is a challenge. Theyre motivated to work together during this unit, which is a great thing to have toward the end of the school year. What is a memorable takeaway for you from professional development training? Actually doing the materials together was really impactful to me. Were learning how to move water from one place to another and design water filtration systems. There were some funny moments along the way that were memorable tooat one point my filter completely collapsed! When I started doing this unit with the kids, I could make suggestions along the way so that they didnt completely lose everything. How has this professional development challenged you to think differently about science education? Ive always considered myself a constructionist, where I dont tell students things but let them discover it for themselves. This professional development reemphasized that method of teaching and how important it is. Once the students learn it for themselves, they dont forget it. If theyre just told what to do, it goes in one ear and out the other. If they discover it for themselves, they can apply it to other situations.",800

While the nation boasts a rich sporting heritage, the sport of football has faced its fair share of challenges. This blog post delves into the history of Indian football, its notable achievements, its subsequent decline, and the factors that have prevented India from emerging as a powerhouse in the global football arena. A glorious past: The roots of football in India can be traced back to the mid-19th century, during British colonial rule. The sport gained popularity among the Indian elite and gradually spread across the country. Indias first official football club, Mohun Bagan Athletic Club, was founded in 1889 in Kolkata, marking the beginning of a vibrant football culture. One of the most remarkable achievements in Indian football history occurred in 1951 when the Indian national team triumphed at the Asian Games in New Delhi, defeating heavyweights like Iran and Indonesia on their path to glory. This success put Indian football on the global map and raised hopes of a bright future for the sport in the nation. The decline: However, despite promising beginnings, Indian football faced a period of decline in subsequent decades. Several factors contributed to this decline, including the lack of infrastructure, poor grassroots development, inadequate coaching programs, limited exposure to international competitions, and a focus on other sports like cricket. As a result, Indian football struggled to maintain its early momentum and fell behind other nations on the global stage. Challenges hindering Indias emergence as a powerhouse: Infrastructure and facilities: One of the key challenges faced by Indian football is the scarcity of quality infrastructure and training facilities. The availability of well-maintained stadiums, training centers, and academies is crucial for nurturing young talent and ensuring their proper development. Grassroots development: The foundation of any successful footballing nation lies in its grassroots development programs. In India, the emphasis on grassroots football has been relatively limited, resulting in a shortage of talent identification and nurturing systems at the grassroots level. Coaching and technical expertise: The development of skilled coaches and technical expertise is vital for the growth of football in any country. India has witnessed a shortage of well-qualified coaches who can effectively impart their knowledge and experience to young players. Competition structure: The structure of domestic competitions plays a significant role in shaping the quality of football. In India, the domestic league system has experienced inconsistencies and lack of long-term planning, hindering the growth of the sport at the professional level. Cultural factors: Indias passion for cricket has often overshadowed the popularity of football. The cultural dominance of cricket, coupled with limited media coverage and sponsorship opportunities for football, has hampered the sports growth and popularity among the masses. The path to powerhouse status: Despite the challenges, there are encouraging signs that Indian football is on the path to revival. The establishment of the Indian Super League (ISL) in 2014 injected new energy and investment into the sport. Additionally, efforts are being made to improve grassroots development programs, enhance coaching education, and upgrade infrastructure facilities. Furthermore, increased exposure to international football through friendlies, participation in regional tournaments, and investment in youth development are steps in the right direction. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has also implemented strategic plans to enhance the national teams performance and increase their FIFA rankings. Indian football has a captivating history, with remarkable achievements, followed by a period of decline. However, the nations potential to emerge as a football powerhouse remains intact. Addressing the challenges of infrastructure, grassroots development, coaching expertise, competition structure, and cultural factors will be crucial in unlocking Indias footballing prowess. With sustained efforts from various stakeholders, including government bodies, football associations, clubs, and fans, India has the potential to rise to prominence in the global football landscape. The journey may be challenging, but the passion for the beautiful game and the untapped talent within the country provide hope for a bright future for Indian football.",664
