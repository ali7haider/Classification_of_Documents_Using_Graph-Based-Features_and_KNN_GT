# Classification_of_Documents_Using_Graph-Based-Features_and_KNN_GT
Project Title: Classification of Documents Using Graph-Based Features and KNN This project offers hands-on experience with graph theory and machine learning, fostering skills in data representation, algorithm implementation, and analytical thinking in the context of document classification.
# Objective:
Develop a system to classify documents into predefined topics by representing each document as a directed
graph, identifying common subgraphs, and applying the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm based on
graph similarity measures.
