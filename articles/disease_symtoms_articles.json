        "title": "8 Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism",
        "content": "Also known as underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a major condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough crucial hormones. There are differentsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidismto notify, in order to get a quality medical response faster. Hypothyroidism might not always offer noticeable symptoms at the early stages, but with time, untreated hypothyroidism will cause serious health issues like infertility, joint pain, obesity, and heart issues. So, proper thyroid tests are essential to perform once you have covered the basicsigns of hypothyroidism. It helps in diagnosing the issue and getting quality results accordingly. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is a pretty simple, effective, and safe one, once you have coveredthyroid infection symptomsquickly and your doctor came across the right dose to use. 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism: Searching the vast world of the internet will not just let you learn about thehypothyroidism effectsbut also provides some surprisingsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism. It is vital to learn about the 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism so that you can get medical attention faster. One of the majorsigns of hypothyroidism, depression will offer mental instability that you want to avoid from the get-go. It is true that hypothyroidism causes the brain to slow down a bit. So, that makes it difficult for the patients to focus, resulting in clinical depression. Most people underestimate the depression level caused by hypothyroidism these days. Whenever you compromise your mood, you will start feeling stiff and weak. These are some of the basicthyroid infection symptomsto watch out for. Unexpected weight gain is another one of the probablehypothyroidism effectson your body. The low-thyroid individuals are signaling their muscles, liver, and even fat tissues to hold onto calories. Whenever your thyroid levels are low, the metabolism will switch modes. So, in place of burning calories for activity and growth, the basal metabolic rate will start to decrease. Therefore, the body starts to store more calories from diet much like fat. Gaining weight seems to be a pretty obvious sign due to such conditions. Even though hypothyroidism can cause some serious issues with memory jogging, some research and scientific notes have proved that it won’t lead to any permanent cognitive dysfunction. So, even though you might face some memory problems, it is only for a limited time span. With proper medications from doctors, you can ward off your memory problems with ease. While looking forsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism, feeling cold seems to be at the top of the list. Heat is mainly the byproduct of burning calories. As your body isn’t burning enough calories during hypothyroidism, you will always feel cold. With hypothyroidism, your BMR is going to decrease, and that reduces the amount of heat that you get to generate. Along with that, the thyroid hormone turns up the thermostat on brown fat that generates more heat. Such brown heat is mandatory for maintaining heat during cold climates. But, hypothyroidism will prevent such fat from doing its job. Lower thyroid hormones will flip the metabolic switch towards that of catabolism. That’s when the body starts to break down the tissues like muscles for energy. During this catabolism period, muscle strength starts to decrease, leading to weakness. This process of breaking down the muscle tissue will cause aching. So, aching in muscles and joints will be another one of the majorsigns of hypothyroidismto follow. Even though everyone feels weak at least once, hypothyroidism people are likely to feel it twice! Much like most cells, the hair follicles are promisingly regulated by none other than the thyroid hormone. As these follicles are noted to have stem cells with a shorter lifespan and higher turnover round, they are likely to be more sensitive to lower thyroid levels than any other tissue. The lower thyroid will cause these follicles to stop regenerating and that gives rise to hair loss. It can be improved when you can treat the thyroid problem from its core. So, if you are suffering from unwanted hair loss, it is one of the majorthyroid infection symptomsto consider. Recent studies have shown that around 25 to 30% of patients, who are suffering from hair loss, were proven to be suffering from hypothyroidism. Skin cells are further characterized by rapid turnover, much like hair follicles. So, they are pretty sensitive to losing the growth signals from that thyroid hormone. If the normal skin renewal cycle gets broken, it takes more time for the skin to re-grow. So, the outer skin layer has been accumulating damage for a long time. The dead skin, at this time, will take a longer time to shed, resulting in dry skin. Some studies have shown that around 74% of low thyroid patients are suffering from a flaky skin condition. So, it is one of the majorhypothyroidism effectsthat your body faces. Other interesting studies have proven that around 50% of patients with normal thyroid levels have stated to suffer from dry skin for other reasons. Recent studies have shown that 50% of people suffering from hypothyroidism have stated that their skin condition has gotten worse within a year of getting affected. So, if you are one of those unfortunate victims of dry skin, check for your thyroid level right away! Lower thyroid levels surely know how to put some brakes on the colon. Constipation will affect around 17% of those people suffering from hypothyroidism. Around 20% of people with hypothyroidism have stated that their constipation has gotten worse with time. Even though it is a common complaint among patients, it is uncommon for constipation to be the most severe symptom around here.

Thus, these countries are in view of the administration of athird booster doseof Covid-19 for addressing the potential fading immunity with time & reduced efficacy against delta variant. A Covid booster dose is an added dose of vaccine given to all individuals after the protection given by the original shot starts declining with time. Thethird vaccine doseindeed helps people in sustaining strong protection from stark coronavirus disease. There is a question that looms large on the minds of the people about the safety of the Covid 19third dose.It is effective in giving protection to people of all age groups that are 5 years and above and severity can be prevented even if a person gets infected with the coronavirus. The number of hospitalization cases has also gone down with thethird booster doseshot. Side effects of a covid booster dose When you get vaccinated with thethird vaccine doseof the Covid-19 vaccine, you will experience similar symptoms to the ones that you experienced after getting a flu vaccine. Symptoms that are common very common include: swollen arm sore throat mild fever headache body ache fatigue for a day or two Swollen lymph and chills can also occur. The above symptoms do not mean that you are sick. It is an indication that your immune system is responding to the vaccine & is building up a guard against Covid-19. A same brand booster dose is not necessary There is a big confusion in the mind of the people taking thethird dosewhether they need to take the booster dose of the same brand as the original dose. Recently, the chief authority has approved a mix and match of brands. Suppose you have taken the original dose of one brand, when it comes to the booster dose, you can take another brand dose. It will not cause any harm and the immunity will be increased to a great extent. The safety concern When it comes to taking thethird vaccine dose,stay assured that it will not have any health issues and is safe to take. It is best to take the booster dose and give a boost to the immunity level that is on the verge of waning after taking the original shots. When an individual completes the vaccination series, protection against the virus starts decreasing with time. Thus, the booster dose is administered to give a boost to immunity. People with comorbidity are highly recommended to take the booster dose. Not only comorbid people but people of all ages above 5 years are recommended to take the booster dose after the original dose. Is a booster dose recommended for all? Athird vaccine dosefor Covid-19 is recommended for people vaccinated already and has a weak immune system. According to the research that receiving a booster dose decrease the infection risk & severe illness from Covid-19. People with moderate and severe debilitated immune systems are highly recommended to get athird booster doseshot of Covid-19. A single booster shot is recommended for people above 5 years after they have taken the initial two doses of covid-19. The booster dose not only boosts the immune system but is a responsible act of the people to protect the family as well as the people surrounding them. Pregnant women can also take the booster dose and no side effects have been found so far. Booster reduces susceptibility to Covid-19 variants Omicronis another variant that is detected globally and to fight this variant, athird booster doseshot has been found to be immensely effective. The emergence of the omicron is a reminder to people globally that people must be careful enough and must practice all covid-19 protocols and should not neglect to take the booster dose. The only way people can fight the pandemic is by wearing a mask and by taking the booster dose. There is no dearth of vaccine availability across the globe. Thus, people should take the vaccine at the earliest if they have crossed the time period after taking the initial doses. Thethird booster doseshot is recommended take after 8months after taking the second dose of Covid-19. It is necessary if any individual wants to achieve protective immunity. People who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine are recommended to go for the booster dose. Thus, the unvaccinated population is at high risk of catching the infection as new variants emerge due to mutation. Gives peace of mind The most asked question among people across the globe is how safe is thethird dose.The booster shot has been found to be absolutely safe and effective. In a recent study by a reputed vaccine manufacturer of Covid-19, it has been published that nearly 10,000 participants took part in a booster trial where half were given a booster and half were given a placebo. As far as safety is concerned, the researchers did not find any adverse effects. It means the result was consistent & with what was found in previous studies. Thus, it can be said that it is completely safe. For people concerned with pericarditis or myocarditis, inflammation of the outer lining of the heart, nothing was observed. In fact, it was found that the group received the placebo had a more serious effect than the booster group. How effective is the booster shot? The booster shot is not only safe & effective for theimmunocompromisedbut for the population at large. It has shown immensely effective in boosting the immunity of an individual tocovid-19. If a person had covid-19 & is completely vaccinated, then also the person needs to take the booster dose.

The blend of prior Covid-19 infection & receiving the vaccine looks extremely powerful against reinfection with the virus SARS-CoV2. Schedule the booster As already mentioned an individual can take the booster dose right after 8 months from the secondcovid dose.Booster is an added protection for people of all age groups above 5 years. Thus, schedule your booster vaccination in the nearest centre from where you received the initial twodoses. When it comes to taking the booster dose, you must not panic about the dose. The same dose as the first and second dose is given to people across the globe. There is no change in dose. A booster dose gives increased protection to an individual. It has been found that all the vaccines that are given for Covid-19 across the globe are completely safe and the efficacy rate is 95%.

What is the Complete Blood Count (CBC) Test? A complete blood count (CBC) is ablood testthat checks for changes in the blood. It gives information about the types and numbers of cells in your blood. The test will measure the number of Red blood cells White blood cells and Platelets present in your bloodstream These three components play important roles in different functions in your body. If any of them is within normal ranges, the corresponding function will be handled efficiently. Low or high counts of these cells indicate a dysfunction or disease. A CBC also shows how well your bone marrow produces healthy blood cells. Everyone has these cells, but certain changes in their numbers can indicate a health problem. What is it used for? The CBC is used to test severaldifferent types of anemia. It can be used to monitor specific conditions such as cancer and heart failure. Hemoglobin levels, or red blood cell count, are also tested to see if the body has enough healthyred blood cells. Platelet levels are also checked to see if there is an adequate level of platelets being produced by the bone marrow. Why do I need a complete blood count? If you have signs or symptoms of infection, your doctor may order a CBC as part of a routine physical exam. It may be ordered if you are being tested for other liver function problems or kidney function problems. A complete blood count is also ordered when you have symptoms that suggest a problem with your blood or if you have a condition that affects your blood cells (such as sickle cell disease). What happens during a Complete Blood Count test?

The specimen will then be sent to the lab for analysis. The amount of blood taken depends on how many tests you’re having done, but it’s usually about 1mL to 3mL. In most cases, you do not need to fast before having this test done. You may eat or drink normally before the test. However, it is advised to drink plenty of water before your appointment.

This will help your doctor identify any potential health issues you may have. Diagnose medical conditions: If you are ill, your doctor will perform a CBC to determine the cause or etiology of your illness and determine yourWBC count. . Typically, this is done when the patient is experiencing symptoms of fatigue, fever, weakness, or even internal bleeding. Monitoring a medical treatment’s effectiveness: A CBC can only be used to monitor specific treatments. Counting your blood cells and white blood cells (RBCs & WBCs) allows the doctors to monitor how well the treatment works. To monitor your health: If you suffer from a medical condition that affects your blood, your doctor may recommend a CBC test to check your blood cell count. Your doctor may prescribe medication or dietary changes to manage the condition. What does a CBC measure? Thecomplete blood count (CBC)is one of the most common tests performed in a doctor’s office or hospital. It measuresred and white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin. Red blood cells are the most abundant type of blood cell and carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues. Your body’s amount of red blood cells depends on your age and sex. This test measures your level of red blood cells. White blood cells are essential for fighting infections, protecting against disease, and healing wounds. There are five different types of white blood cells:neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. You can determine how many white blood cells you have by taking this test. Platelets help prevent bleeding by forming clots at sites where vessels have been injured or damaged. If you lose too many platelets, you could bleed excessively after an injury or surgery. This test measures how many platelets you have per microliter of blood (microliters). Hemoglobin is the protein in your blood that holds oxygen. The test determines the Hb level of the patient and the HbA1C level of blood glucose to determine if the patient is not suffering from pre-diabetes. A red blood cell scale is used to measure the size of the RBC. The size of these cells provides significant information about the patient’s medical condition. A high MCV indicates low folate orvitamin B12levels if your cells are larger than usual. If the size is smaller, this may be a sign of anemia. A doctor can determine how many red cells are present in your blood by measuring this. Low percentages may indicate iron deficiency. The mineral iron is responsible for thered blood cell count. However, if your score is high, you may be dehydrated or suffering from another condition or disorder. What does the result indicate? CBCs measure the number of cells in your blood. If your counts are not within normal ranges, there may be several reasons. These include: Hematocrit or red blood cell levels that are abnormal can be signs ofanemia, heart disease, or low iron levels. White cell count may be low due to certainautoimmune disorders, bone marrow disorders, or cancer. A high white blood cell count could result from an infection or an adverse reaction to medicine. When your levels are abnormal, it does not always mean you have a medical problem that requires treatment. Diet, activity level, medicine, menstruation, and not drinking enough water can affect the results. CBCS is useful for evaluating an individual’s overall health. CBCs are associated with very low or no risks. There is only one procedure that involves taking a blood sample from the patient. By the results of this blood test, the next phase of treatment can be determined. Present in 9 locations across 8 major cities in India,  Dr. Remedies Labs offersCompleteBlood Count testsas a part of its various packages at affordable prices. On taking an appointment, qualified phlebotomists will visit your residence or office to collect the samples and revert with the reports by email.

        "title": "PCOS in women: its effects, symptoms, and lifestyle changes to overcome￼",
        "content": "Nowadays, lifestyle changes are causing abnormalities in women’s periodic cycles, which later become symptoms of lifestyle diseases. These diseases are hormonal balance issues, thyroid disorders,polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), etc. The effects of PCOS, their long-term consequences, and the symptoms to recognize them will be discussed in this article. It is essential to know the long-term health risks associated withpolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) to make the appropriate decision regarding your health. Infertility or subfertility Endometrial cancer Diabetes Lipid abnormalities Cardiovascular risks Obstructive sleep apnea Although PCOS does not cause these conditions in all women, it increases your risk of developing them. Therefore, it is imperative to see a physician who has experience treating women with PCOS regularly to keep track of your health. It is essential to see a physician regularly throughout your reproductive years and even after menopause. This is even if you no longer have irregular periods and othersymptoms of PCOSlessen. Many thousands of women with PCOS are treated for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome every year. PCOS Effects and Risks that may occur Often, women who cannot get pregnant are not aware that they have PCOS until they see their doctor.Women with PCOSmay have infertility (reduced fertility). A hormonal imbalance caused by an overproduction of testosterone could explain this. Sometimes, ova (eggs) are not released from the ovaries. Assisted reproductive technologies and ovulation-inducing drugs have made it possible for many women with PCOS to conceive. Even though PCOS lowers a woman’s chances of getting pregnant, the disease is not a substitute for birth control. Despite the condition, many women can conceive naturally without medical assistance. Contraceptives are recommended for women who are sexually active and do not wish to become pregnant. Endometrial cancer (which can occur at the lining of the uterus) appears as the highest risk for women with PCOS in the latter part of their life. Women of all age groups experience a monthly buildup of the endometrial lining in the uterus. The lining is normally shed at ovulation in the case of non-pregnant women. It is the process of preparing the body to gain the potential for a fertilized egg. Though there is an experience of the monthly buildup of the endometrial lining, due to the infrequent or nonexistent menstrual periods in women with PCOS, the lining is not shed sufficiently. Thus the lining continuously builds and will increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Sugar (glucose) is metabolized or processed by the body with the help of insulin. Impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance has been linked to PCOS. In addition, PCOS is aggravated by high levels of insulin, which stimulate testosterone production. Up to40% of women with PCOShave abnormal glucose tolerance by age 40, either diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. 4. Lipid Abnormalities Women with PCOS are at risk for having unfavorable lipid profiles due to hyperandrogenism (increased testosterone). As a result, a woman with PCOS may have a high level of fat substances in her bloodstream. The blood lipid profile of some women may show a lower percentage of high-density lipoproteins (HDL, the “good” cholesterol) and a more significant percentage of low-density lipoproteins (LDL, the “bad” cholesterol). As a result of this imbalance, cardiovascular disease is more likely to occur. PCOS is associated with an increased risk for heart disease and othercardiovascular diseases in women. The tendency for women with PCOS to be overweight increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, just as obesity increases cardiovascular disease risk for women and men without PCOS. Several studies have confirmed that women with PCOS are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Increased body weight on this risk is apparent, but women with PCOS are also at high risk. The high testosterone levels in PCOS may also contribute to the development of sleep apnea. Dr. Remedies Labsoffers a package for women to determine if they have PCOS, lipid profiles, cholesterol values, diabetes, and other issues. Other checkups are even included in the package, such as thyroid profile, arthritic risk, etc. For regular checkups to enhance your lifestyle orPCOS problems, please browse ourRemedies Labsand get checked up at an affordable price.",

In some women, hemoglobin deficiency may occur. Taking time to exercise, manage stress, and eat right are essential habits for every woman. Routine health screenings are among these habits, which can detect problems at an early stage. Getting screened regularly could even save your life. You can prevent complications and increase your quality of life when you detect disease early. This will improve and change the course of your life. Women diagnosed with early cancers have recovered after undergoing treatment in many cases. Women need some special examinations to be undergone because, though various health conditions affect both men and women, some affect women more often and differently. Most drug trials fail to include female test subjects, and many conditions that affect women go undiagnosed. However,some health concerns are exclusive to women, such asbreast cancer, cervical cancer, menopause, and pregnancy. Heart attacks and urinary tract infections are more common in women than men. Women are also more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety disorders than men. The below-mentioned illnesses are more prevalent among women. Heart Diseases Women are more at risk of developing heart disease than men. However, many of them are unaware of the threat.Heart attacksare more likely to occur if you suffer fromhigh blood pressure or cholesterol issues.Check-up is mandatoryto avoid the risk of threat. Breast cancer Usually originating in the milk duct lining,breast cancercan spread to other organs and is the most aggressive cancer in females worldwide. Developed nations have a higher prevalence of this condition among their female populations due to their longer life expectancies. Breast cancer patientsare likely to developlumps in their breasts. Breast lumps are often harmless, but women should have each one checked by a healthcare professional. Ovarian and cervical cancer Most of us are unaware of the differences between ovarian cancer and cervical cancer.Cervical cancerdevelops in thelower uterus, whileovarian cancerdevelops in thefallopian tubes. In both cases, the pain is unbearable. It is possible todetect cervical cancer by a pap smear, whereasovarian cancer requires more tests. This disease manifests in vague symptoms that should be considered seriously. Gynecological Health It is natural forwomento experience bleeding and discharge during theirmenstrual cycle. It is important to note that additional symptoms during menstruation may indicate health issues and that unintended symptoms, such asbleedingbetweenmenstruations and frequent urination, can indicate otherhealth problems.

Even though some infections are easily treated, they can lead to severe conditions like infertility and kidney failure if left untreated. Pregnancy Issues Pre-existing conditions can worsen the condition duringpregnancy. It sometimes threatens the health of the mother and the child. If asthma, diabetes, or depression are not appropriately managed, they can harm both mother and child.A mother’s red blood cell count may drop due to anemia during pregnancy.The implantation of a reproductive cell outside the uterus also makes further pregnancy difficult. It is also problematic when a reproductive cell implants outside the uterus, making further gestation impossible.Obstetriciansare able to manage and treat a wide range of medical conditions during pregnancy. Autoimmune diseases When viruses attack healthy cells,autoimmune diseasesoccur. As this condition continues to escalate, it is astonishing to learn that women are mostly affected by such diseases. A common symptom of such autoimmune diseases is exhaustion, mild fever, pain, skin irritation, and vertigo.

Choosing thebest diagnostic centercan be confusing when you don’t know what questions to ask. Learn how to choose the best diagnostic center based on the doctors who’ve been there and on other features. There are several essential factors to consider before selecting the best Diagnostic center: 1. Qualification of the medical staff A diagnostic center should have a qualified medical staff to handle your health issues. The center should have experienced and skilledradiologists, pathologists, surgeons, and other medical professionals. The doctors are highly qualified and experienced in their specialty. They also have enough knowledge about different tests and procedures to be followed when treating an individual. The most important thing is to ensure that the doctor you choose has a license to practice medicine in your state. This license allows them to treat patients legally and prescribe medicines according to their needs. 2. Availability of the latest equipment All diagnostic centers use advanced technology for their services. You should check whether the facility has the latest equipment or not. If it does not, then you cannot expect high-quality results from them. 3. Ambiance and hygiene Every diagnostic center must follow proper hygiene while providing its services. If they do not follow these measures, there is a risk of infection among patients and medical professionals working at the facility. Therefore, make sure that they follow all safety measures while performing their tests on patients! 4. Quality of the services It is essential to look at what kind of quality services your preferred diagnostic center offers for its patients to ensure that it will meet all your needs. Make sure that the facility provides excellent care and attention to its patients. 5. Range and availability of tests The diagnostic center should be familiar with all types of diagnostic testing and procedures required to diagnose various diseases or conditions. It should provide a wide range of tests, includingblood tests, urine tests, X-rays, etc., which can help identify various diseases in children such as diabetes, cancer, thyroid disorders, and more. Make sure that there is no delay for these tests as they may be required at short notice due to an emergency or sudden change in your child’s health condition. 6.

Pricing and payment facilities across various diagnostic centers You need to understand how much each test costs at the diagnostic center before deciding where to go for testing. The best way to find out about this information is by asking them directly about it or by checking for yourself online or on other websites so that you don’t get overcharged for your tests when you go there. 10. Experience and customer reviews Another thing to consider when choosing a diagnostic center is its reputation and experience. It’s essential that the center has been around for some time and has a good track record for treating patients with similar conditions as yours. This shows that they have successfully treated other patients with similar conditions and, therefore, can give you confidence in their ability to treat yours too! The best way to check out their reputation is by searching online reviews, especially those posted by former patients who have used them before The cost of the services offered by the center should also be considered.

        "title": "What are pathology tests?",
        "content": "Pathologyis a surgical subspecialty, also known as the study of diseases or specific diseases; it is a field of medicine most often associated with the diagnosis and study of diseases such as cancer. More generally, pathology is the study of changes in an organism caused by disease, the normal and abnormal structure, function, and behavior of living systems. Pathology testsare used to diagnose disease. They help reveal the actual cause of specific diseases likeautism, cancer, Crohn’s, and dementia. They can show you problems in the body but treat them by treating the symptoms. Pathology tests simulate what happens to your body when you suffer from a specific disease. Tests are done on the cells of the specific organ in question, and the results help doctors get more information about that particular disease. Various pathology tests: Pathology tests are meant to determine if there is a specific disease or combination of diseases. They differ based on a few diseases and specific criteria for diagnosis. When you get asked by your doctor which test is required for your condition, you will know the difference in pathology testing. These criteria can be found in other medical conditions as well. Unlike lab tests, pathology tests are typically carried out atpathology laboratories, and doctors often have no idea what the results mean. Pathologies have to be diagnosed and the results interpreted first before one expects the final results of such an audiovisual testing program. There are many ways to diagnose a medical condition. The test that is used depends on what we are looking for and how serious the condition is. There are manydifferent types of pathology tests, but they all fall into one of three categories: 1. Blood, urine, and saliva tests (known as “serum” tests) 2. Imaging scans (such as X-rays and ultrasounds) 3. Biopsy samples (tissue samples taken from inside the body) There are two ways to help diagnose more medical conditions. 1. Physical examand a complete medical history, which can be found in most doctor’s offices. Not all doctors offer this type of diagnostic procedure, so it is up to the patient to find one they do. 2. Clinical tests:A clinical test checks blood, urine, or other body fluids for changes in levels of certain chemicals or vitamins, which can indicate disease processes. This type of test requires many hours of work by technicians and can often seem pointless unless the results indicate a significant change in health status. Why are these tests necessary? Pathology tests are a big part of healthcare. These tests are essential, from spotting cancerous cells to determining a patient’s muscle stiffness.  As you have seen, there are many different types of pathology tests. Still, the most basic types focus on removing stains for different cell types, organs, and tissues in their respective exam rooms. 4 reasons why you need apathology testare: 1. Identifies likely health risks:A pathology test can help you determine your risk of developing a specific disease in the future by checking the levels of certainproteins and antibodies in your blood. For example, if you’re worried about heart disease, a cholesterol test is an excellent place to start. 2. Screening for disease:Some pathology tests are used as part of a screening process. For example, if you’re over 40 years old and haven’t had a pap smear before, your doctor might recommend one, so they can check for signs of cervical cancer or other conditions that could cause problems later on. 3. Diagnosing the correct disease:An accurate diagnosis is vital if you have symptoms that point towards a specific condition or disease. This will help your doctor decide what treatment options are best suited to you and whether any further investigations are needed. 4. Monitoring a condition or treatment:Some pathology tests aim to find out how well treatments are working or whether you’ve experienced any changes in your health. For instance, if you have diabetes, you may need regular blood tests to determine how well your glucose levels (blood sugar) are functioning. If you want to get apathology testdone, you have to reach out to a lab specializing in the same. Dr. Remedies Labs is the best in pathology tests, and they offer you the best packages for every test at an affordable price. They even help you get your reports that come from the lab, analyzed.
