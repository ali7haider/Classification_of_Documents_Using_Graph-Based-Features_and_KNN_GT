2024-04-27 21:14:45,disease_symptoms,The Vitamin D Deficiency Test: How Can You Find Out If You Are Deficient?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/vitamin-d-deficiency-test/,"One of the common deficiencies that most people are suffering from is Vitamin D deficiency. Doctors are recommending avitamin d deficiency testto find out where you currently stand. This form of deficiency will cause issues with your muscle and bones. It affects people over the age of 65 mostly and those with darker skin tones. But, with proper advice and a doctor’s help, this deficiency is easily treatable. More on vitamin D deficiency: As the name suggests, vitamin D deficiency actually means your body is not having the right level of vitamin D it deserves. Most of you might want to knowwhat is vitamin d test. Well, this test helps you to know the level of vitamin D your body has and if it is running towards a deficiency level. With a lesser vitamin D count, your bones will start to feel weak, along with your muscles. Vitamin D is one prime vitamin that the body uses for normal bone development and proper maintenance. It even plays a major role in the immune system, musculoskeletal system, and nervous system. There are different ways in which your body can get the right amount ofvitamin d levels in bloodas it needs. The first and foremost option is through UV rays. But, people who are older and those with darker skin might not get the right amount of Vitamin D through sunlight. Furthermore, your geographical location will also determine the amount of sunlight your body can get. The next stop is the foods that you eat, through which you will receive the much-needed Vitamin D. There are some nutritional supplements recommended by doctors once you have done through propervitamin d deficiency test, only if your body needs it. The importance that comes with Vitamin D: Your body seriously needs an appropriate amount of Vitamin D to stay fit and healthy. It plays a major role to maintain a proper balance of calcium within your bloodstream and bones and also to maintain it. Specifically, you need proper Vitamin D so that your body can use phosphorus and calcium to build strong bones and also support healthy tissues. Understandwhat is vitamin d testbefore you plan to get one. It will let you know if you are suffering from chronic Vitamin D deficiency. With a chronic deficiency level, there will be a decrease in phosphorus and calcium absorption within your intestines. It can lead to hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency can also causehyperparathyroidism, where the overactive parathyroid gland will try to keep blood calcium levels normal. Both these issues can get severe if your Vitamin D deficiency is not treated on time and can cause some serious symptoms likefatigue, depression, muscle weakness, and cramps. For balancing the calcium levels within your blood, your body will take calcium from bones. It can eventually lead to accelerating bone demineralization. If not treated on time, this situation will result in osteomalacia in adults. Children can suffer from rickets. Osteoporosis and rickets can increase the chances of bone fractures. As a child’s bone is still at its growing stage, demineralization will cause bent or bowed bones. If you want to prevent these issues from hampering your life, then managing propervitamin d levels in bloodis the main clue to consider over here. Who will get highly affected by Vitamin D deficiency? Anyone can be a victim of vitamin D deficiency. So, doctors are always recommending patients move on with avitamin d deficiency testnow. Not just adults, but children and even infants might suffer from the high-end deficiency level right now. This form of deficiency is highly common among people with higher skin melanin content or darker skin. It is also common among those people who tend to wear clothes with high-end skin coverage. Right now, vitamin D deficiency has become a common global phenomenon. Around 1 billion people, worldwide, are suffering from this issue. Around 50% of the world’s population has insufficient vitamin D consumed by their bodies. In the USA, around 35% of adults are victims of vitamin D deficiency nowadays. So, getting proper treatment has become a necessity these days. The signs and symptoms: It is true that you have your answer onwhat is vitamin d test. It shows if you are one of those people suffering from vitamin D deficiency or not. But, even if you don’t take the test before, there are some signs that will help you to know if you might be one such victim. Let’s learn about those symptoms now. Children can suffer from rickets due to vitamin D deficiency. Some of those symptoms among kids are muscle weakness, incorrect growth patterns, pain in the bone, and joint deformities. Children who are suffering from mild deficiency levels might feel weak and sore muscles or painful muscle tissues. Adults will feel fatigued and have bone pain as well if they have lowervitamin d levels in blood. Other than muscle cramps and weakness, some other symptoms of vitamin D deficiency will be mood changes like depression. However, it is not always common to have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Some people may not face any of the issues mentioned above, but still, end up being a victim of deficiency. That’s why the vitamin D test is vital for all. More about the vitamin D deficiency test: Generally speaking, there are different types of vitamin D deficiency tests available. It is widely used for screening lower levels of vitamin D in your blood. So, you can get the treatment going ASAP with supplements before the deficiency level can cause some serious health problems. If you are known to have a bone disorder or issues absorbing calcium, then a vitamin D test is done to see if you lack the appropriate amount of it in your body.

His journey from Malm FF to AC Milan has been one of the greatest. Scoring over 500 club goals, he has been giving pleasure to millions of football fans across the globe for more than two decades. His goals have been mind blowing! The strategy, the movement and the execution is unimaginable. Widely known for his bicycle goals, the karate kicking goals and his dribbling skills, he is literally one of the worlds finest players. Well known for his savage comments and comebacks in football, Zlatan never fails to disappoint the media. One such incident was when Cristiano Ronaldo scored a beautiful bicycle kick from Real Madrid against Juventus in 2018 Champions League. Referring to this goal, one interviewer asked Zlatan, Cristiano Ronaldo scored today, how would you describe that? And who is a better goal scorer, you (Zlatan) or Ronaldo? Zlatan replied with, He (Cr7) scored a beautiful goal today but he should try it from 40 meters. The interviewer roared with laughter and this caught attention of the fans and media pretty quick. Zlatan was referring to his bicycle kick goal against England which he scored from 40m. A sensational goal it was, contributing to his memorable career. Zlatans amazing goal from Ajax against NAC football club has gone down in history books. He dribbled past 5 opponent players and the goal keeper, leaving them all confused. And the list of goals and assists go on and on. Once in an interview, he was asked which superpower would he like to possess and he replied, I already have them. Media, yet again got a Classic Zlatan answer. The 41 year old had shared a great bond with Lionel Messi, having played with him in Barcelona during 2009-11. Zlatan was always ready to stand up for his Argentinian friend, preferring him in award shows and interviews. Zlatan was given a grand farewell by AC Milan. The striker announced to AC Milan fans that he will he will retire after they played their final game of the season against Hellas Verona on Sunday. Ibrahimovic was in tears in front of the San Siro crowd as he bid farewell to the club and called time on his glittering career. He has been one of the most magnificent player of this football era. The little kids who had just started being fond of football because of him to the old ones who enjoyed seeing him play, shed tears during Zlatans retirement speech. This retirement was enough to make an old man cry. Zlatan retiring from football is an end of a powerful era. Having contributed so much to football, all fans gave him a big thanks. He has surely blessed our eyes by his career. However, during his speech, he was interrupted by loud booing by the fans of Verona. Zlatan fired back the perfect response saying, Keep booing. This is the biggest moment in your year seeing me. Its only true that, Lions, they dont compare themselves with humans.- Zlatan Ibrahimovic",525

That’s whyregular checkupsfor most people are essential to good health. Your eyes, ears, heart, and many other parts of your body need to be checked regularly to ensure nothing is developing in a problematic way. Regular health checkupsare a great way to keep your body in good condition and ensure you stay healthy throughout your life. You may not think much about your health, but regular checkups are essential to any medical treatment plan. Here are some of the mainadvantages of having regular health checkups. Advantages of Regular Full Health Check ups It helps you keep track of your health status and helps you stay on top of any changes in your body. It allows your doctor to monitor your medications and make changes if needed, ensuring that they’re working as they should be. Improvement in overall health status is possible. In addition to catching common illnesses such as colds and the flu, regular checkups can detect other diseases that are easier to spot in day-to-day activities (e.g., high blood pressure). It is essential to know that the earlier a disease is detected, the better your chances are of getting better. By having regular checkups, you can prevent the onset of diseases that could potentially threaten your life in the future. It’s easier to treat an illness when it’s still in its early stages.

Not only do I work towards making sure my classroom is a safe place, but I also work to make sure that if any student wants to perform an experiment or participate in an activity, they can perform that activity as best they can. The following recommendations are based on personal observations and experiences as well as, suggestions Ive received from friends and students with disabilities. I offer them as a way to start to engage students with disabilities and create a more inclusive learning space: Ask your student what works for them instead of assuming. Each student is different and unique; and every individual that identifies with disabilities is different. Even if they both are visually impaired, for instance, their needs and accommodations are going to differ and as an educator, one should not assume. Rather, speak with the student. Ask the student what their needs are. Ask the student what works for them and what doesnt. Invite your student to participate in how accommodations in the IEP are implemented. The conversation of accommodations and accessibility is an ongoing one. The conversation doesnt stop with the first day of school IEP meeting. Even if you get the IEP at the beginning of the school year, ensure that you speak with the student to know what works for your subject and your classroom space. While each teacher receives the same accommodations list for a particular student, the way those accommodations are applied in a biology class versus an English class may not be the same. Make sure that the accommodations are serving the student to support their learning at the same level and rigor as the rest of the class, not to use the accommodations to make the assignment or task easier to accomplish. Allow every student a chance to participate in classroom activities. Dont assume that your student can or cannot do something because of their disability. Give everyone a chance. Let the students try and try again. I always tell my students that failure is not the end of the road. Failure or the word fail, means First Attempt In Learning. I always ensure my students know that they have chances to succeed. As the teacher in the room, I make sure that the students learn from each attempt and are constantly improving. Having a growth mindset not only helps my students with ensuring they are challenging themselves and gaining new skills, it also helps me as the educator learn what works for different needs and then be able to call on those experiences when helping a future student. Try new things. Be innovative. Dont live inside a box. If the standard or commonly accepted solution doesnt work for one student, keep working with them to find something that will work. Think creatively. Because I have a disability, I realize how important it is to recognize the person first, because it is not the only thing that defines me. I am an individual with a disability, not a disabled individual. That is why I always strive to hold my students to the same rigor and expectations regardless of the differences among them. I help them pursue their passions and if modifications are needed along the way to ensure equity, work together as a team to ensure that can happen.",561
2024-04-27 21:38:11,sports,Unending saga of smashing racquets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/legalperspectives/unending-saga-of-smashing-racquets-54954/,"Tennis is usually considered the gentlemans sport and of course why not? It is indeed an individual sport requiring great strength and endurance. But certain acts dont do justice to such labels. Tennis players are seen smashing their racquets in a fit of rage. Considering the other side of the coin it might not seem all wrong as there is immense pressure players are in and sometimes such rage acts make them cool down but should this be supported or appreciated? Smashing racquets is legally prohibited by the rules of tennis and is considered very unsportsmanlike having huge penalties and fines associated with it. A large number of players chose this violation each year. The racquet abuse rule includes intentionally and violently destroying rackets, and equipment or hitting the net and umpires chair. This can attract fines ranging from $500  $2500 per violation and many times even a point penalty, game penalty, or getting defaulted in extreme cases. It is a violation of the code of conduct, there is a risk of injury, damage, and negative impact on the game and everyone. Maybe the players can afford to lose racquets in such a way, but this should not be promoted. Videos can be easily found in YouTube titles such as Most epic racquet smashes. The dilemma is, what is epic in this? In cricket, when it rains, the cricketers try to protect their bat first before themselves, in many cultures whenever a foundation is laid for a building the equipment is first worshipped, even in wars the weapons were worshipped before going into the battlefield. These are means of your livelihood and should be respected. Talking about tennis, the racquet is all the means because of which the players are playing in that position, earning money, income, feeding the family, and they have all they want because of it. Young children look up to these players aspiring to be like them one day, and such furious actions do make them frown. And it also comes as a surprise that it seems strange to see these players gaining too much success and experience, to react in this way. And by smashing the racquets they prioritize it over actually winning the game. These reactions are also welcomed with boo from the audience.  Nick Kyrios is the player who has one of the most racquets smashes and has probably paid a lot of fines as well. Novak Djokovic showed disappointing behavior by smashing racquets, screaming, hitting the net, and even throwing his racquet into the audience in the auspicious 2020 Olympics. This type of activity not only disrespects the sport, but also the racquet, the court, the audience, and the fans. The Olympics is such a big organization and people work day and night to get to represent their country in it. Djokovic displaying this behavior was embarrassing. Rafael Nadal condoned his demeanor and was thankful as there was no one sitting in the stands. Winning and losing are part and parcel of any game, especially in tennis where there are no draws. Racquet abuse is a way to promote unacceptance of loss which is not something any sport is meant for setting poor examples for others. Hence, there could be more constructive ways to manage emotions in court thereby ending the saga of smashing racquets.",554

They are transmitted by either the Aedes albopictus mosquito or the Aedes aegypti mosquito. These mosquito species reside in tropical and subtropical areas globally. Their related infections have grown big times in recent years. A mosquito that carries the virus will pass it down to a human by biting him. When another mosquito bites an infected person, it picks up the disease and will pass it on to the next person it bites. We believe it to be one of the majorcauses ofdengue fever.

2024-04-27 22:34:06,science_education,A Sign of Apocalypse,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/sign-apocalypse,"Throughout mankinds history we have looked to the sky for inspiration, navigation, and guidance in understanding our world. Astronomical phenomena have influenced our creation myths and religions. The magnificent display of a lunar eclipse has impacted cultures and inspired fear throughout mankind's past. The lunar eclipse is one of the most documented astronomical occurrences in history. For thousands of years, civilizations have been observing its red glow and attributing meaning to the sight. Many feared that the lunar eclipse was an omen of evil or an indication that tragic events were on the horizon. The Ancient Mesopotamians, one of the early cultures to study astronomy and track the movements of celestial objects, believed that during the lunar eclipse, the Moon was being attacked by demons. Their astronomical observations and recordings were advanced enough that they could predict when a lunar eclipse would occur. In 1502 Christopher Columbus and his men were stranded in Jamaica and had been surviving with help from the native Tano people. However, the natives grew increasingly impatient with the European squatters beginning to refuse aid and supplies to Columbus and his men. Columbus used information from an almanac of astronomical tables, which informed him of the occurrence of a total lunar eclipse within a few days. He told the natives that if they did not continue giving him food and supplies his god would inflame the Moon with his wrath as a sign of future punishment. As predicted the lunar eclipse followed. Terrified by the blood-colored Moon they acquiesced to Columbus demands. Lunar eclipses have also aided in furthering our understanding of our universe. The Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos, known for proposing the first Helio-Centric (sun-centered) model of the solar system made great strides in the field of astronomy. He famously used the occurrence of a lunar eclipse and his understanding of mathematics to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. By using a known size of the Earth and measuring the duration of the lunar eclipse, he was able to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. While relatively inaccurate, he was the first to ever do this calculation. While for most people the lunar eclipse no longer signifies the coming of an apocalyptic event, the mystique surrounding the infamous Blood Moon holds to this day. The lunar eclipse is in fact not mystical at all; it is quite simply the Earth passing in between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. As the Moon begins to be shadowed from part of the Sun's light, the Moon will appear to dim (see Figure 1). This is when the Moon passes into an area called the penumbra, the part of the shadow where the entirety of the Moon is still illuminated by the Sunlight, however part of the Sunlight is blocked by the Earth causing the drop in brightness. When just this happens it is called a penumbral eclipse and this accounts for most lunar eclipses. On even rarer occasions, the Moon will then begin to disappear into the night sky. This occurs as the Moon passes into the umbra, where all direct sunlight is blocked casting a dark shadow on the Moon. The Moon will fully disappear entering what is called totality. Then the lunar eclipse shows its true colors. Ethan GevinsonFigure 1. Parts of a lunar eclipse. Image not to scale. Even when the Moon is entirely in the umbral shadow, some light manages to reach the Moon by passing around the Earth, through the atmosphere. This causes a change in color due to a principle called Rayleigh scattering, and this is the same principle that gives the sky its blue color. This principle states that when light passes through a medium such as the atmosphere, shorter wavelength of light is scattered more. What we end up seeing is that light towards the blue end of the spectrum is scattered more than red light since blue light has a shorter wavelength (e.g. Figure 2). This gives the effect of different colors of light being refracted at different angles similar to light passing through a prism. Ethan GevinsonFigure 2. Bluer light has a shorter wavelength and redder light has a longer wavelength. This is also why sunrises and sunsets appear red. As the Sun appears to set on the horizon, the sunlight passes through the longer path of Earths atmosphere to reach your eyes than when it appears high in the sky. The blue light is scattered away while the red light could reach us. Interestingly, when we are looking at a lunar eclipse, the red light projected onto the Moon is the light of sunrises and sunsets that we see on Earth (Figure 3). So if you manage to see a blood Moon, you can consider yourself lucky, as you are seeing the light from all of the sunsets and sunrises from around the world being projected onto the Moon. Ethan GevinsonFigure 3. The light from the Sun being scattered by the atmosphere, giving the Moon its red color. When is the next lunar eclipse? On May 5th, 2023 between 15:15 and 19:32 UTC the Moon will pass into the Penumbra creating a nearly total penumbral eclipse visible from most of Europe, Africa, and Asia (Figure 5). This type of eclipse unfortunately will not result in the iconic Blood Moon, just simply a dimming of the Moon with darker shading on one side. Whether you are able to see the upcoming eclipse or will be holding out until the next total lunar eclipse in March of 2025 it is an impressive sight to behold. People have always looked to the skies for answers and have learned from events like the lunar eclipse. To join them all you need to do is look it up. Ethan GevinsonFigure 4.

2024-04-27 21:14:48,disease_symptoms,8 Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/8-signs-and-symptoms-of-hypothyroidism/,"Also known as underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a major condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough crucial hormones. There are differentsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidismto notify, in order to get a quality medical response faster. Hypothyroidism might not always offer noticeable symptoms at the early stages, but with time, untreated hypothyroidism will cause serious health issues like infertility, joint pain, obesity, and heart issues. So, proper thyroid tests are essential to perform once you have covered the basicsigns of hypothyroidism. It helps in diagnosing the issue and getting quality results accordingly. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is a pretty simple, effective, and safe one, once you have coveredthyroid infection symptomsquickly and your doctor came across the right dose to use. 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism: Searching the vast world of the internet will not just let you learn about thehypothyroidism effectsbut also provides some surprisingsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism. It is vital to learn about the 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism so that you can get medical attention faster. One of the majorsigns of hypothyroidism, depression will offer mental instability that you want to avoid from the get-go. It is true that hypothyroidism causes the brain to slow down a bit. So, that makes it difficult for the patients to focus, resulting in clinical depression. Most people underestimate the depression level caused by hypothyroidism these days. Whenever you compromise your mood, you will start feeling stiff and weak. These are some of the basicthyroid infection symptomsto watch out for. Unexpected weight gain is another one of the probablehypothyroidism effectson your body. The low-thyroid individuals are signaling their muscles, liver, and even fat tissues to hold onto calories. Whenever your thyroid levels are low, the metabolism will switch modes. So, in place of burning calories for activity and growth, the basal metabolic rate will start to decrease. Therefore, the body starts to store more calories from diet much like fat. Gaining weight seems to be a pretty obvious sign due to such conditions. Even though hypothyroidism can cause some serious issues with memory jogging, some research and scientific notes have proved that it won’t lead to any permanent cognitive dysfunction. So, even though you might face some memory problems, it is only for a limited time span. With proper medications from doctors, you can ward off your memory problems with ease. While looking forsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism, feeling cold seems to be at the top of the list. Heat is mainly the byproduct of burning calories. As your body isn’t burning enough calories during hypothyroidism, you will always feel cold. With hypothyroidism, your BMR is going to decrease, and that reduces the amount of heat that you get to generate. Along with that, the thyroid hormone turns up the thermostat on brown fat that generates more heat. Such brown heat is mandatory for maintaining heat during cold climates. But, hypothyroidism will prevent such fat from doing its job. Lower thyroid hormones will flip the metabolic switch towards that of catabolism. That’s when the body starts to break down the tissues like muscles for energy. During this catabolism period, muscle strength starts to decrease, leading to weakness. This process of breaking down the muscle tissue will cause aching. So, aching in muscles and joints will be another one of the majorsigns of hypothyroidismto follow. Even though everyone feels weak at least once, hypothyroidism people are likely to feel it twice! Much like most cells, the hair follicles are promisingly regulated by none other than the thyroid hormone. As these follicles are noted to have stem cells with a shorter lifespan and higher turnover round, they are likely to be more sensitive to lower thyroid levels than any other tissue. The lower thyroid will cause these follicles to stop regenerating and that gives rise to hair loss. It can be improved when you can treat the thyroid problem from its core. So, if you are suffering from unwanted hair loss, it is one of the majorthyroid infection symptomsto consider. Recent studies have shown that around 25 to 30% of patients, who are suffering from hair loss, were proven to be suffering from hypothyroidism. Skin cells are further characterized by rapid turnover, much like hair follicles. So, they are pretty sensitive to losing the growth signals from that thyroid hormone. If the normal skin renewal cycle gets broken, it takes more time for the skin to re-grow. So, the outer skin layer has been accumulating damage for a long time. The dead skin, at this time, will take a longer time to shed, resulting in dry skin. Some studies have shown that around 74% of low thyroid patients are suffering from a flaky skin condition. So, it is one of the majorhypothyroidism effectsthat your body faces. Other interesting studies have proven that around 50% of patients with normal thyroid levels have stated to suffer from dry skin for other reasons. Recent studies have shown that 50% of people suffering from hypothyroidism have stated that their skin condition has gotten worse within a year of getting affected. So, if you are one of those unfortunate victims of dry skin, check for your thyroid level right away! Lower thyroid levels surely know how to put some brakes on the colon. Constipation will affect around 17% of those people suffering from hypothyroidism. Around 20% of people with hypothyroidism have stated that their constipation has gotten worse with time. Even though it is a common complaint among patients, it is uncommon for constipation to be the most severe symptom around here. Get proper diagnostics from Remedies Labs: The signs, mentioned above, will help you to clearly decipher if you are suffering from hypothyroidism or not. In case you are facing some serious issues and need help, call the team fromRemedies Labsto the rescue. Get your thyroid diagnosed to start proper medications immediately.

2024-04-27 22:34:13,science_education,Stories of Women of Color in STEM: Robin Kumoluyi,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/stories-women-color-stem-robin-kumoluyi,"Robin Kumoluyi dreamed of becoming a scientist long before she stepped into a laboratory. She grew up in New Jersey with a lot of curiosity. This curiosity about her environment sparked her interest in the world. She began to ask how the things around her worked. This inquisitive nature led her to do some of her first science experiments before she was a teenager. My neighbors had a lilac tree in their yard, and I kept smelling this wonderful aroma, Robin said. I decided it was a good idea to climb the fence, go into their yard, pick flowers, and try to figure out how to make water that smelled like those flowers. I traded dolls for a miniature microscope when I was about nine years old, Robin said. The microscope was a birthday present. She used it to explore the world around her. I wasnt interested in dolls, I was interested in the world, she explained. Robin began to learn about microbiology in high school. She had a mentor who worked in the field. Microbiologists study living organisms that are too small to be seen with the naked eye, like bacteria. Time spent in the lab with her mentor deepened her interest in science. Robin also became an avid reader. Being able to see a microbiologist who looked like me, an African-American, in real life, was fabulous, she said. Knowing someone like herself fueled Robin. She pursued biology at Rutgers University. She planned to become a doctor. Then Robin fell in love with her microbiology classes. She decided to shift her career interests to microbiology. Through her classes, she became fascinated by the process that uses microorganisms to make foods and medicines. Running her first PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test merged Robins course work and interests. PCR tests amplify pieces of DNA. They are used to study genetic material. Seeing something that you learn in school actually being applied in real life was fascinating to me, she said. These real-life uses inspired Robin to support peoples health through medicine. Robins grandmother struggled with diabetes. Seeing that inspired Robin to focus on developing quality and accessible medicine. She wanted to help people enjoy their lives. Robin is now the Vice President and Chief Quality Officer, Pharmaceuticals, at Johnson & Johnson. In her role, she makes sure that the medicine her team creates is safe and effective for patients to use.  For me, its more about caring about people than it is about medicine, she said. I found that this was a way to care about people and support them on lifes journey by giving them something that made them strong and well. Robins goal of helping others with their health grew during the COVID-19 pandemic. She became committed to tackling health care inequities. I was extremely moved and motivated by the level of health care disparities uncovered during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said. We always knew that health care disparities were there, but the pandemic really highlighted them to a point of unbelief. Robin and her team helped in delivering Johnson & Johnsons COVID-19 vaccine to patients around the world. She described the moment as a once-in-alifetime opportunity that will impact the world. Robin hopes to continue to develop quality medicines, fight health care inequities, and mentor young people who are interested in science.

2024-04-27 21:38:30,sports,WTC loss to Australia brings back memories of 2003 WC final for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/cricket-corner/wtc-loss-to-australia-brings-back-memories-of-2003-wc-final-for-india-55107/,"Ankit Kumar Singh Australias emasculation of India in the World Test Championship (WTC) final at The Oval on Sunday felt like a dj vu of the 2003 ODI World Cup finale when the two cricketing powerhouses had last met in the final of an ICC event. Ever since the inaugural ODI World Cup was played in England 52 years ago, there have been 22 ICC tournaments so far (12 ODI World Cups, 8 ICC Champions Trophies, 2 WTCs). However, only on two occasions, India and Australia have clashed in the final with the men from Down Under emerging triumphant on both occasions. The first of these occasions materialized at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg 20 years ago when the two sides battled it out for the ODI WC crown. The recently concluded WTC final marked the second encounter between the two proud nations. There are some uncanny similarities between the two finals which took place in two different decades. On both occasions, an Indian captain won the toss and chose to field first only to see the opposition batters send his bowlers on a leather hunt. Also, a pair of Australian batters took the game away from India in each of these two games that was played at a neutral venue. In 2003 it was Sourav Ganguly who won the toss and opted to bowl first. The decision clearly backfired as Australia went on to amass a mammoth 359/2 in 50 overs on the back of a sterling hundred from Ricky Ponting (121-ball 140) and an elegant 84-ball 88 from Damien Martyn. In reply, India were bowled out for 234 to hand over the WC title to the Australians. Cut to the 2023 WTC final at The Oval and a similar script unfolded on Day One with Rohit Sharma sending Australia in after winning the spin of the coin. After India had Australia reeling at 76/3, two opposition batters  Travis Head (163, 174 balls) and Steve Smith (121, 268 balls)  turned the game on its head with a partnership of 285 runs for the fourth wicket. Riding on their magnificent tons, Australia posted a huge first-innings total of 469 which set up their 209-run decimation of India in the end. REVENGE OF THE AUSSIES For Australia, the WTC triumph also marked the end of a six-year jinx featuring their Test battles with India. Since 2017, they had lost four back-to-back Test series against India with two of these defeats coming in home conditions. One of these series included the four matches played in 2020-21 when India were skittled for 36 in the second innings of the first Test in Adelaide before making a comeback for the ages to trample the hosts in Melbourne, pull off a draw in Sydney and then breach the seemingly impregnable Gabba despite missing the services of several key players to register a historic 2-1 win. India were also the only team to have beaten Australia in the current WTC cycle that began in 2021. Out of the six series they played during this period, they won five of them including victories over England (4-0), South Africa (2-0) and the West Indies (2-0) at home, and a memorable 1-0 win in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, they had to share the spoils 1-1 while in India, they suffered a 2-1 defeat. In the WTC final, though, Australia were the better side of the two by miles. They outshone India with both bat and ball to take home their 9th ICC silverware, a record no other country is even close to emulating. India and the West Indies (five each) are jointly second on the list of teams with most number of ICC trophies. Advance Australia Fair.",621

2024-04-27 22:34:15,science_education,"Professional Development in North and South Carolina, vol. 2",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/professional-development-north-and-south-carolina-vol-2,"The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) launched theSmithsonian Science for North and South Carolina Classroomsprogram in 2019 with a U.S. Department of Education early phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR)grant. Read the first installment in this blog serieshere. Donna Godley is a fifth grade science teacher at Tryon Elementary School in North Carolina and her school's site coordinator, responsible for supporting her fellow teachers and communicating with the other key players in the program. In March and August 2021, she attended professional development on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom moduleHow Can We Provide Freshwater to Those in Need?in preparation for implementing it with her students. We spoke with Donna to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: How did you feel when you learned you were going to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for North Carolina and South Carolina program? Did you have any expectations? Donna:Our Superintendent signed our school up and was looking for teachers to be a part of the program. I teach 5th grade science and were departmentalized. So after I volunteered, I also became a coordinator for my school. I worked with some of the Smithsonian Science units before and traveled to D.C. with other teachers for Smithsonian-related things several years ago. The quality of the Smithsonian programs are usually pretty good, so I felt like the effort I would be putting into it would be worth it for my students. What was your experience with the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom module you covered during the professional development? What was your experience going through the curriculum during the professional development? My unit was an [Engineering] design unit, and its about moving water from one area to another. The people that weve worked with anytime weve done the training have been great. Its been virtual, of course, because of COVID but the instructors have always been really good. The written materials, especially the teacher manual, is always so self explanatory because it covers everything in great detail. You can watch the videos if you have questions on anything. The teacher materials and the resources the Smithsonian Science Education Center provides are exceptional. Actually sitting through the material makes me more familiar with it, and I could teach the lessons without professional development because the materials are so high quality.  In this screenshot from PD, Donna describes her group's rationale for sorting images of landforms in a jamboard. What was it like for you to work with other teachers and coordinators during the training? It was great to receive feedback from others. I worked with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers from my school to help them figure out how they were going to teach the lessons. At the end of each year we hold a debrief to discuss highlights and how were going to work through certain challenges and implement them for the following school year. What has this experience been like for your students? The kids have loved it. With all of the hands-on activities, they say oh, were really scientists! It was so exciting for them to see crates of new materials they were going to work with. They really enjoy doing the design units because they had the opportunity to be creative and use the materials how they liked. Usually when Im doing things in my classroom, theres not a wealth of material to use and were limited to what Ive purchased. Everyone was very engaged because they were so enthralled with everything they were getting to use. They really enjoy being creative and it has really helped them with teamwork. In 5th grade, getting along and working together is a challenge. Theyre motivated to work together during this unit, which is a great thing to have toward the end of the school year. What is a memorable takeaway for you from professional development training? Actually doing the materials together was really impactful to me. Were learning how to move water from one place to another and design water filtration systems. There were some funny moments along the way that were memorable tooat one point my filter completely collapsed! When I started doing this unit with the kids, I could make suggestions along the way so that they didnt completely lose everything. How has this professional development challenged you to think differently about science education? Ive always considered myself a constructionist, where I dont tell students things but let them discover it for themselves. This professional development reemphasized that method of teaching and how important it is. Once the students learn it for themselves, they dont forget it. If theyre just told what to do, it goes in one ear and out the other. If they discover it for themselves, they can apply it to other situations.",800
2024-04-27 21:38:40,sports,"The journey of Indian football: Achievements, decline and the path to powerhouse status",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/theintersection/the-journey-of-indian-football-achievements-decline-and-the-path-to-powerhouse-status-54826/,"Football, often hailed as the worlds most popular sport, has had a fascinating journey in India. While the nation boasts a rich sporting heritage, the sport of football has faced its fair share of challenges. This blog post delves into the history of Indian football, its notable achievements, its subsequent decline, and the factors that have prevented India from emerging as a powerhouse in the global football arena. A glorious past: The roots of football in India can be traced back to the mid-19th century, during British colonial rule. The sport gained popularity among the Indian elite and gradually spread across the country. Indias first official football club, Mohun Bagan Athletic Club, was founded in 1889 in Kolkata, marking the beginning of a vibrant football culture. One of the most remarkable achievements in Indian football history occurred in 1951 when the Indian national team triumphed at the Asian Games in New Delhi, defeating heavyweights like Iran and Indonesia on their path to glory. This success put Indian football on the global map and raised hopes of a bright future for the sport in the nation. The decline: However, despite promising beginnings, Indian football faced a period of decline in subsequent decades. Several factors contributed to this decline, including the lack of infrastructure, poor grassroots development, inadequate coaching programs, limited exposure to international competitions, and a focus on other sports like cricket. As a result, Indian football struggled to maintain its early momentum and fell behind other nations on the global stage. Challenges hindering Indias emergence as a powerhouse: Infrastructure and facilities: One of the key challenges faced by Indian football is the scarcity of quality infrastructure and training facilities. The availability of well-maintained stadiums, training centers, and academies is crucial for nurturing young talent and ensuring their proper development. Grassroots development: The foundation of any successful footballing nation lies in its grassroots development programs. In India, the emphasis on grassroots football has been relatively limited, resulting in a shortage of talent identification and nurturing systems at the grassroots level. Coaching and technical expertise: The development of skilled coaches and technical expertise is vital for the growth of football in any country. India has witnessed a shortage of well-qualified coaches who can effectively impart their knowledge and experience to young players. Competition structure: The structure of domestic competitions plays a significant role in shaping the quality of football. In India, the domestic league system has experienced inconsistencies and lack of long-term planning, hindering the growth of the sport at the professional level. Cultural factors: Indias passion for cricket has often overshadowed the popularity of football. The cultural dominance of cricket, coupled with limited media coverage and sponsorship opportunities for football, has hampered the sports growth and popularity among the masses. The path to powerhouse status: Despite the challenges, there are encouraging signs that Indian football is on the path to revival. The establishment of the Indian Super League (ISL) in 2014 injected new energy and investment into the sport. Additionally, efforts are being made to improve grassroots development programs, enhance coaching education, and upgrade infrastructure facilities. Furthermore, increased exposure to international football through friendlies, participation in regional tournaments, and investment in youth development are steps in the right direction. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has also implemented strategic plans to enhance the national teams performance and increase their FIFA rankings. Indian football has a captivating history, with remarkable achievements, followed by a period of decline. However, the nations potential to emerge as a football powerhouse remains intact. Addressing the challenges of infrastructure, grassroots development, coaching expertise, competition structure, and cultural factors will be crucial in unlocking Indias footballing prowess. With sustained efforts from various stakeholders, including government bodies, football associations, clubs, and fans, India has the potential to rise to prominence in the global football landscape. The journey may be challenging, but the passion for the beautiful game and the untapped talent within the country provide hope for a bright future for Indian football.",664
2024-04-27 21:14:49,disease_symptoms,10 Common Monsoon Diseases and Various Ways to Prevent Them,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/10-common-monsoon-diseases/,"After sultry summer months, monsoon comes as a relief. However, with rain, you have to deal with unwantedmonsoon disease. It will make your life a living hell. From malaria to Cholera, dengue to even chikungunya, there are loads of conditions, and some even prove fatal. Each year, different mosquito types are born. They can cause an outbreak of disease. We are ready to discuss some home remedies available to preventdiseases during the rainy seasonto keep the surroundings free from mosquitoes. We will inform you how to protect against deadly mosquito bites inside and outside your home. To keepmonsoon illnessat bay, we will notify you of ten common monsoon diseases and how to prevent them big time. Get yourself tested atRemedies Labsif you face any symptoms, as mentioned below. Here are 10 Common Monsoon Diseases: Anopheles is the leading cause behind the spread ofmalaria. This parasite starts to breed during monsoon season. Malaria takes place due to water logging. It is because most mosquitoes breed in streams and waterways. Malaria is a notedmonsoon diseaseand will cause severe fever, running as high as 105 degrees C and can linger for multiple days. Some of the significant symptoms are body chills, discomfort and high fever. We believe the easy way to keep malaria mosquitoes at bay is by avoiding water storage. Avoid storing water in any place and prevent malaria mosquitoes from breeding. Among all thediseases during the rainy season, we have seen patients withdengue fever. Brought to you by tiger mosquitoes, dengue symptoms are high fever, hypersensitivity, muscle and joint pain, and lower platelet count. We suggest you use insect repellents to keep the mosquito out of your house or workplace. While going to sleep, always use a mosquito net. In case a dengue outbreak takes place, stay inside your home. Chikungunya feveris mainly spread by mosquitoes that hatch in stagnant water, as available in refrigerators, AC, utensils, and plant pots. The mosquito that carries thismonsoon illnessis Aedes Albopictus, which can bite you anywhere during the day and night. Joint discomfort and fever are two symptoms our lab experts have identified. To prevent such mosquito bites, avoid stagnant water. Get yourself tested right now through us atRemedies Labs. Known as a water-borne disease, Salmonella typhi bacteria causes typhoid. It spreads out because of improper sanitation and by eating spoiled food or drinking polluted water.Typhoid feveris contagious during monsoon season, and it is a prettymonsoon diseaseall across the globe. Some of the most common causes are contaminated food and water. So, prevent taking in such contaminated food items if you want to keep the illness at bay. Some of the symptoms mentioned here are constipation, abdominal pain, higher fever for a long time,headache, sore throat, joint pain and vomiting. Another commondisease during the rainy seasonis Cholera. If you ever consume contaminated food and water, chances are high that you will be struck with Cholera, especially during monsoon season. Even poor hygiene and sanitation will cause this disease. We suggest the victims opt for immediate treatment as Cholera can cause death within hours. To prevent such an issue, you can use Odomos mosquito repellent spray or repellent cream to keep the mosquitoes away. Some symptoms are thirst, lower blood pressure, muscle cramps and rapid heart rate. Even though a pretty common disease throughout the year, it is highly prevalent during monsoon season. Some symptoms you see here arefatigue, fever, dizziness, body chills, weakness and joint and muscle pain. It is hard to avoid viral fever, but you can try to keep yourself away from rainwater. Avoid getting drenched when it is raining. Even if you do get drenched, pat yourself dry immediately. If you are facing any symptoms, call us for the lab tests. Another one of the most common illnesses during the monsoon season isDiarrhoea. It can range from temporary conditions to even some life-threatening ones if not taken care of on time. Consuming unclean food and water is some of the reasons behind Diarrhoea. Some common symptoms are loose, watery stools, fever, bloating, abdominal cramps and nausea. Avoid consuming unsanitary food items if you want to keep thismonsoon illnessaway from you. Whenever there is a change in weather and temperature fluctuations, Influenza takes place. It is mandatory to keep yourself protected as it can turn into a viral infection pretty fast. Influenza is easily transferrable from one person to another. So, covering yourself properly with clothes and preventing rainwater from drenching you are some ways to keep yourself free from Influenza. We have listed some significant symptoms: fever, sweating, aching muscles, nasal congestion, sore throat and dry, persistent cough. Please consult us atRemedies Labsfor a proper examination right away! It is one primary bacterial infection transmitted to humans from animals. If you have open cuts or bruises, it is always better to cover them up while stepping out of your room or house to avoid getting this disease. During hardcore monsoon time, this bacterial infection might occur if your skin is prone to water-logging.  Some common symptoms arehigh fever, muscle aches, headaches, red eyes, rashes and abdominal pain, followed by Diarrhoea. Whenever you consume unhygienic food items and liquids, chances are high that you will suffer from stomach infections. Gastroenteritis is one of the most common stomach infections during monsoon season. Drinking boiled water during this time and only opting for a home-cooked meal are some solutions to keep yourself away from stomach infections. Some significant symptoms of stomach infections are lower-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and more. Make sure to get yourself examined ASAP with us to help start with the medications right away!

It will cause the victim to feel fatigued, achy and irritable most of the time. Some of the other symptoms are coughing, nausea and runny nose.",1108
2024-04-27 22:34:23,science_education,"Professional Development in North and South Carolina, vol. 4",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/professional-development-north-and-south-carolina-vol-4,"The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) launched theSmithsonian Science for North and South Carolina Classroomsprogram in 2019 with a U.S. Department of Education early phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR)grant. Read theprevious installmentin this blog series here. Margaret Lorimer is an Education Specialist atSolutions in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (STEM Centers SC)and formerly a K-8 mathematics teacher. She has attended and facilitated professional development for fifth grade teachers in South Carolina on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom modulesHow Can We Provide Freshwater to Those in Need?in summer 2021 andHow Can We Identify Materials Based on Their Properties?in summer 2022. We spoke with Margaret in 2021 after virtual professional development to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: What are the benefits to students who are experiencing theSmithsonian Science for the Classroommodules taught by trained teachers? Margaret: The kids when the modules are implemented are learning by doing. Theyre digging in and theyre able to interact with the content and to do some sense making of their own so that theyre understanding the concepts better. I think thats really the power of a system that uses these kinds of modules where the students are not just reading about the science, theyre actually interacting with it. Theyre doing experiments, have their hands on it, and have their brains engaged with it. They have opportunities to question and form ideas and then decide whether or not those ideas are viable and then come back around and say, well I dont think thats why this works, lets try it this way. SSEC: How would you describe the differences between the introductory and intermediate 5thgrade training sessions? Margaret: The introductory sessions focused on the content of the module and it was taking a look at the 5thgrade content and the science and engineering processes that were involved in teaching that content. The introductory piece was this is what kids will be doing, this is how kids do this. The intermediate PD was more about the science content knowledge for the teachers, giving them a chance to really dig into some of the science concepts themselves and build their own understanding. I really believe, and my experience has shown me this, that the deeper the teachers content knowledge is, the more flexible they can be in their instruction. They can work with students on their misconceptions and help them build their understanding of the content. SSEC:How do you seeSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacting South Carolina teachers? Margaret:The teachers are coming up with questions that they want to investigate based on the content in the modules that theyre learning. I hope that something like what happened to me happens to them where they go, oh wow, Ive thought this about that particular phenomenon, let me think about why it works the way that it does. I really think that its hard to teach what you havent experienced, I dont think its impossible, but I think that its hard and so if the teachers who have been through this training have fit it into their framework of thinking about science and how they think about science instruction then theyre going to take that in their classrooms and theyre going to give their kids the same opportunities that they had to question their thinking, interact, and learn. As it impacts the teachers, its going to impact the students.  In this screenshot from PD, Margaret facilitates a conversation with teachers. SSEC:How has leading professional development onSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacted your own practice? Margaret: When we did the professional development with Smithsonian, the train-the-trainer pieces, all the strategies that we want teachers to use with their kids, were embedded in that PD, so we experience the strategies as learners and then we want the teachers to take those. We want the folks who experienced those strategies that were embedded in that PD to then take it and use it with their students. For example, a lot of times when you think about your own instruction in science, when you were a learner, when you were a student, you get this list of vocabulary words and you find out what all the definitions of the vocabulary words are and then you do the learning about the science thats attached to the vocabulary words. But really, its better to have an experience that [the] vocabulary is embedded in and you have to use it to have the experience. Then at the back end you talk about the meanings of the words. That was embedded in the intermediate piece: that teaching strategy was introduced to them and they were encouraged to apply that to other science instruction. SSEC:What is the impact of this for you and how do you see this potentially changing science and STEM education? Margaret: People will not do what they have not experienced themselves. If the only science instruction theyve ever experienced is show and tell where I do it as the teacher, we do a few things together, and then you go and do some stuff on your own for practice, if thats all theyve ever experienced, thats how theyre going to teach. That makes perfect sense because we do what weve been taught to do, so having training like this that is based in inquiry, that is built around the science and engineering practices, if they experience it as learners, then they are much more likely to carry it into their classrooms and do it that way with their students. The strength of programs like theSmithsonian Science for the Classroomis the teacher support pieces. If Im a K-5 teacher and Im not real sure about my content, then Im going stick with whatever the textbook tells me to do, but if I have a Smithsonian module and Ive learned how to use it, then the teacher supports that are built into that make it much easier for me to take the risk to do science a little differently with my students, so thats where the power to make change comes in.",1009
2024-04-27 21:38:44,sports,Team India needs a magic combination of youth and experience,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/economyreweave/team-india-needs-a-magic-combination-of-youth-and-experience-55274/,"The performance of some youngsters was outstanding in the IPL 2023. Some of them can be picked up for the West Indies tour and for the ICC World Cup. Young players should get a chance in their 20s and not in their 30s. The senior and experienced players should not play for decades and leave the scene for the young talents who can instill life into the team. Team India should be a magic combination of youth and experience. Ruturaj Gaekward and Shubman Gill are straight bats with strong defense as well as aggression; they have a wide range of strokes. They can give India a good start. Both are gifted players and can do very well in the Indian condition. The duo should not hesitate to take tips from the former masters like Sunil Gavaskar, Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar so that they could overcome their unseen flaws in their batting and temperament. It is very essential for the opening pair. Yashasvi Jaiswal can come at the first down and the next slot should go to Sai Sudharshan; both are disciplined, technically sound and they have a wide range of strokes. They are in good form and this is the right time to play these players in the team. Hit the iron when it is red hot. Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane will be the pillars of the Indian batting and both should dig in and play the role of finishers. Rahane is in magical touch but he is not tough enough to carry the bat. Kohli is tough and he can do the impossible with his ability to improvise. But, Kohli has to be extra careful against the out-swingers pitching on the off stump and on outside the off stump. We cant keep Ishan Kishan waiting as the wicket keeper batsman. He can hit hard, rotate the score board and pile up runs in the middle. Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja should always be in the all rounder list. India will have a very strong middle order who can manage the tail also. Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Harshdeep Singh, Bhubaneswar Kumar and Mohammed Shami are good enough to manage the pace attack well; all have bites, movement and bounce. Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel are the perfect choice for the spin attack. The good news is that Axar Patel, Shardul Thakur, Muhammad Shami, Bhubaneswar Kumar and Bumrah can contribute in batting. So the Indian tail looks formidable with so many pinch hitters. A few Indian top order batsmen should develop the ability to bowl so that they could be used as surprise weapons in the ICC World Cup before they are tested in the West Indies. So the fantastic team for the ICC World Cup should be Ruturaj Gaekward, Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, K Sudarshan, Virat Kohli, Rahane, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Surya Kumar Yadav, Shardul Thakur, Harshdeep Singh, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel. All these players should be included in the West Indies tour; their potential will be tested there before the prestigious ICC World Cup. Rohit Sharma, Ravichandra Aswini, Cheteswar Pujara and Umesh Yadav should make room for the youngsters who can instill vibrancy into the team.",537
2024-04-27 21:14:51,disease_symptoms,Is The COVID-19 Third Booster Dose Really Safe?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/is-the-covid-19-third-booster-dose-really-safe/,"It has been found that several countries are experiencing a reappearance of Covid-19 driven mainly by thedelta variant of SARS-COV-2. Thus, these countries are in view of the administration of athird booster doseof Covid-19 for addressing the potential fading immunity with time & reduced efficacy against delta variant. A Covid booster dose is an added dose of vaccine given to all individuals after the protection given by the original shot starts declining with time. Thethird vaccine doseindeed helps people in sustaining strong protection from stark coronavirus disease. There is a question that looms large on the minds of the people about the safety of the Covid 19third dose.It is effective in giving protection to people of all age groups that are 5 years and above and severity can be prevented even if a person gets infected with the coronavirus. The number of hospitalization cases has also gone down with thethird booster doseshot. Side effects of a covid booster dose When you get vaccinated with thethird vaccine doseof the Covid-19 vaccine, you will experience similar symptoms to the ones that you experienced after getting a flu vaccine. Symptoms that are common very common include: swollen arm sore throat mild fever headache body ache fatigue for a day or two Swollen lymph and chills can also occur. The above symptoms do not mean that you are sick. It is an indication that your immune system is responding to the vaccine & is building up a guard against Covid-19. A same brand booster dose is not necessary There is a big confusion in the mind of the people taking thethird dosewhether they need to take the booster dose of the same brand as the original dose. Recently, the chief authority has approved a mix and match of brands. Suppose you have taken the original dose of one brand, when it comes to the booster dose, you can take another brand dose. It will not cause any harm and the immunity will be increased to a great extent. The safety concern When it comes to taking thethird vaccine dose,stay assured that it will not have any health issues and is safe to take. It is best to take the booster dose and give a boost to the immunity level that is on the verge of waning after taking the original shots. When an individual completes the vaccination series, protection against the virus starts decreasing with time. Thus, the booster dose is administered to give a boost to immunity. People with comorbidity are highly recommended to take the booster dose. Not only comorbid people but people of all ages above 5 years are recommended to take the booster dose after the original dose. Is a booster dose recommended for all? Athird vaccine dosefor Covid-19 is recommended for people vaccinated already and has a weak immune system. According to the research that receiving a booster dose decrease the infection risk & severe illness from Covid-19. People with moderate and severe debilitated immune systems are highly recommended to get athird booster doseshot of Covid-19. A single booster shot is recommended for people above 5 years after they have taken the initial two doses of covid-19. The booster dose not only boosts the immune system but is a responsible act of the people to protect the family as well as the people surrounding them. Pregnant women can also take the booster dose and no side effects have been found so far. Booster reduces susceptibility to Covid-19 variants Omicronis another variant that is detected globally and to fight this variant, athird booster doseshot has been found to be immensely effective. The emergence of the omicron is a reminder to people globally that people must be careful enough and must practice all covid-19 protocols and should not neglect to take the booster dose. The only way people can fight the pandemic is by wearing a mask and by taking the booster dose. There is no dearth of vaccine availability across the globe. Thus, people should take the vaccine at the earliest if they have crossed the time period after taking the initial doses. Thethird booster doseshot is recommended take after 8months after taking the second dose of Covid-19. It is necessary if any individual wants to achieve protective immunity. People who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine are recommended to go for the booster dose. Thus, the unvaccinated population is at high risk of catching the infection as new variants emerge due to mutation. Gives peace of mind The most asked question among people across the globe is how safe is thethird dose.The booster shot has been found to be absolutely safe and effective. In a recent study by a reputed vaccine manufacturer of Covid-19, it has been published that nearly 10,000 participants took part in a booster trial where half were given a booster and half were given a placebo. As far as safety is concerned, the researchers did not find any adverse effects. It means the result was consistent & with what was found in previous studies. Thus, it can be said that it is completely safe. For people concerned with pericarditis or myocarditis, inflammation of the outer lining of the heart, nothing was observed. In fact, it was found that the group received the placebo had a more serious effect than the booster group. How effective is the booster shot? The booster shot is not only safe & effective for theimmunocompromisedbut for the population at large. It has shown immensely effective in boosting the immunity of an individual tocovid-19. If a person had covid-19 & is completely vaccinated, then also the person needs to take the booster dose. The booster dose is found to be protective for that population and also is not at all harmful. The blend of prior Covid-19 infection & receiving the vaccine looks extremely powerful against reinfection with the virus SARS-CoV2. Schedule the booster As already mentioned an individual can take the booster dose right after 8 months from the secondcovid dose.Booster is an added protection for people of all age groups above 5 years. Thus, schedule your booster vaccination in the nearest centre from where you received the initial twodoses. When it comes to taking the booster dose, you must not panic about the dose. The same dose as the first and second dose is given to people across the globe. There is no change in dose. A booster dose gives increased protection to an individual. It has been found that all the vaccines that are given for Covid-19 across the globe are completely safe and the efficacy rate is 95%. This dose is required by all and sundry for getting maximum protection. Risk of getting covid after the booster dose For an individual who got infected with covid 19, there is 99% less chance of reinfection after receiving the booster dose. Here are the facts let’s take a look: After taking the 1stdose, 10% of people got infected After receiving the 2nddose, 4% of individuals caught the infection After taking the 3rddose, 1.5% of people develop the infection.

2024-04-27 22:34:29,science_education,Fall in Review,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/fall-review,"Smithsonian Science Education Center attended Climate Week in New York City with representatives from Smithsonian including SERC, STRI, SSEC, and NMNH. During the weeks events, the Smithsonian Science Education Center brought K-12 sustainable development education to a global stage and joined the discussion on advancing the Global Goals. Some of the events included: A panel held by Innovation 4.4, a group convening family offices, governments, and corporate leaders to accelerate the deployment of solutions most needed to create better futures for all. Founded by impact thought leader, investor, and entrepreneur Lina Constantinovici, Innovation 4.4 is an official partner to the United Nations Association. Director of SSEC Carol ODonnell joined the panel to discuss SSECs impact and alignment to this mission. Director Carol ODonnell sat on a NEST/Climate Week panel on Climate Action through community focused philanthropy. The Nest Climate Campus hosted a dynamic three-day event featuring thought-leading demonstrations of climate action and an array of workshops and roundtable discussions, and community engagement activities that provided rich networking opportunities for attendees. Smithsonian Science Education Centers UNGA/Climate Week Event. In this intimate, high-level Roundtable focused on Perspectives in Climate Education, SSEC examined data from two recent global surveys of young people and educators, assessing strengths and gaps in the landscape. Participants engaged in conversation about positioning youth to lead in achieving the SDGs, from their vantage points as organizational leaders. The event was co-hosted by the Smithsonian, Ernst & Young, and the Diplomatic Courier, and took place on Thursday, September 21st from 11:30-2:30 at the Cushman and Wakefield Offices at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10104.

2024-04-27 21:38:47,sports,Again fell short!,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/theblogger/again-fell-short-55551/,"The baton has passed on successfully. We have taken the tag of modern chokers from South Africa as we again landed where we were two years ago. The crushing defeat in the 2023 WTC final has once again unleashed the weaklings India team suffer from. Again therell be contemplation over Indias loss and voices will emerge from every nook and corner to change the captain and the entire team if need be. But all will be forgotten, once the team starts its another WTC cycle after a month. The same critics will cheer for the team in the world cup scheduled later this year. In India, cricket is a religion and players are worshipped as Gods. Before every important match, videos and photos surface on the internet showing crazy fans worshipping their cricketing idols. Being an Indian cricket fan is traumatic particularly in ICC tournaments. Since weve once again fallen short of an ICC Trophy, its time that we analyse what went wrong for us and what were the domains where we could have planned meticulously. IPL is the elephant in the room Though its certain that IPL brings much needed glory to cricket, it binds Indian players to get stuck to it, thanks to the big bonanza it guarantees. This years IPL was no different. Indian players earned enormously from the IPL but at the cost of WTC preparations. Indian players didnt get much time to prepare for the final as the IPL ended on 29th May. With only a week of practice they entered into the finals and put up a forgettable show. The same was heard of in the post match conference when Indian captain complained about lack of practice and teams inability to acclimatise according to the overcast conditions. Poor team selection Before the match, it was said that UK weather is seamer friendly which means four pacers and one spinner would be the right composition for playing eleven. Keeping this in mind, the worlds number one ranked bowler was reduced to a bencher who would bring drinks to quench the thirst of those playing. R. Ashwin might have chosen another business over cricket had he had little knowledge about this. In fact he showed his willingness to be a part of playing eleven but unfortunately luck didnt favour him. This strategy of Indian think-tank fell miserably as Ashwins counterpart Nathan Lyon proved us wrong and performed exceedingly well. Absence of chief selector Ever since former chief selector Chetan Sharma has stepped down from his position, SS Das is the acting chief. It is unimaginable for a team who has great records in the past matches to enter into the final of an ICC event without a fully functional selection committee. Now as fingers are being raised at the committee, BCCI in hurry is showing some signs of tackling the issues by hurriedly filling up all the vacant positions. It would not be wrong to say that Indian politics more or less has taken a toll on BCCI as well as bigwigs here often seem to be influenced by it. Dismal performance by top batters Indian batters are known for their perseverance and grit. There have been several occasions when they have won innumerable matches for us. But this time when all eyes were glued to the TV screen, our batters could not live up to their fans expectations. Our batting order fell like a peck of cards with only a few scores of fifty or plus. If one looks at the past batting records of the Indian batters in tests, it would become clear that our batters are suffering from century drought. All Indian batters collectively have not scored as many centuries as English batter Joe Root has scored in the past two years. This shows the striking difference between batters of both the countries. Majority of top Indian batters are in their 30s with retirement looming over them. Its time that selectors pay close heed and begin grooming young talents so that they can get ready for national duty. Shorter version of cricket has higher emotional investment in India We, as cricket fans, have to blame ourselves too because we dont put much effort when it comes to cheering for test cricket. Whenever India loses any white ball ICC tournaments, critics start going down hard on Indian players with sting in their voices. The same goes missing in red ball ICC tournaments. Here there is a hue but not so sharp as one which we as a critic produce for the former one. The pop culture puts all its focus on the white ball cricket feats rather than putting up less attention to the historical test match winstoo gives less attention to the historical test match wins. Barely an average Indian cricket fan may be knowing about any of the historical moments associated with test cricket as he in all likelihood finds it tedious to follow the red ball cricket. It would be okay for us if we say that India is not among the favourites to win this years ICC mens world cup, though it will be played in India. When team India will start its outing in yet another ICC tournament, it will be laden with hopes and dreams of billions of cricket fans across the globe as always has been the case who always support the team no matter what.",899

2024-04-27 22:34:33,science_education,"Professional Development in North and South Carolina, vol. 1",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/professional-development-north-and-south-carolina-vol-1,"The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) launched theSmithsonian Science for North and South Carolina Classroomsprogram in 2019 with a U.S. Department of Education early phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR)grant. Read the second installment in this blog serieshere. Designed to provide ongoing curriculum and professional development support to teachers, educators receive inquiry-based science training on Smithsonian Science for the Classroom modules to build their own confidence and subsequently that of their students in science, math, and reading. Over 150 third, fourth, and fifth grade science teachers in 7 school districts across the two states have been impacted through this program to date. Jennifer JJ Waddell is a science teacher at Polk Central Elementary School in North Carolina. While her school is now entering its third year of implementation, spring 2021 was the first opportunity for teachers to participate in professional development and receive curriculum. She received in-depth training on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom moduleHow Can We Provide Energy to Peoples Homes?during the spring 2021 professional development session. We spoke with JJ to learn more about her experiences throughout the professional development.  SSEC: How did you feel after finding out you were going to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for North Carolina and South Carolina program? Did you have any expectations? JJ:We were told by our curriculum instructional administrator that this was a really great program. We were excited and (still are) to do the professional development with the Smithsonian Science Education Center. Energy is such a big part of our curriculum in North Carolina for 4th grade, so it was really cool that something that we teach was made into something broader with the information that we were given through the Smithsonian. The books and additional material really go in-depth into energy, batteries, electricity, and all things that are important for energy. {The professional development allows them to have a deep dive of the lesson}. These are things that we would love to teach our kids, but we may not always have the opportunity to, whether its a time crunch or the way that the material was laid out. Its a good indicator of hey, we can get this done. We had a few teachers who had been through a similar program a few years ago, so we had a little bit of background of what to expect. Our administrators and those who had taken courses in the past from the Smithsonian thought they were great. It was really impactful to see how this was going to be useful in the classroom. What would you describe as the most impactful moment for you during your professional development? There was a really big lightbulb moment on day two that we realized all of the different lessons were connected intricately and built upon each other. It started at a primary level by using basic knowledge that kids were already coming to the table with, and then increased the knowledge base. You couldnt do lesson 3 without doing lesson 2 and I really enjoyed seeing that aspect. Oftentimes we have curriculum that diverges here and there, so we constantly feel like we have to do extra research or extra activities to fill in gaps. The [Smithsonian Science for the Classroom] had no gaps and went further in-depth of the knowledge base that the kids should already know. Even if the student didnt understand it the first time around, they were definitely going to on the second trytheres a constant spiraling review of the whole process that uses the same science content language.  In this screenshot from PD, JJ and others view the Carolina Science Online interface. In your experience, how has this curriculum differed from ones you might have taught in the past? Theres a lot of project-based learning that we went through with Smithsonian Science for the Classroom. It seemed like almost all of the lessons we went over included an experiment with reasoning and observations instead of just presenting information in a textbook. It provided resources and let the students investigate different approaches to science, which was really cool. How has this professional development challenged you to think differently about science education? Its easy for me, and I have to catch myselfnot to just give them the answer. Its really been eye opening for me to realize that the kids just need to use that deductive reasoning and that theyve got to do this on their own. Im quick to just give them hints to lead them in the right direction for time's sake, but Im realizing that so much of the lesson builds off the previous that if I didnt get it all in during a 45-minute session that theres always tomorrow. They really enjoy it, and it really challenges me too. What was it like for you to meet other teachers who were becoming acclimated to Smithsonian Science for the Classroom? It was great to have that collaboration and to see things that worked in different situations. We often had discussions about remote learners versus in-class learners and some of the strategies they were using.",850

2024-04-27 21:14:52,disease_symptoms,5 Important Facts about My Genetic Test,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/5-important-facts-about-my-genetic-test/,"A lot has changed in the last couple of years when it comes to DNA testing. Some of you might not even knowwhat is genetic test. Well, it is one way to now test for over 100 diseases before pregnancy or you get to predict cancer before even it starts to develop in your body. Right now, researchers are using the power of DNA testing to target medication responses better for various conditions. With so manytypes of genetic testingavailable, you might sometime wonder if going for this test is suitable for you or not. There are some important facts for you to consider as you start navigating through the world of genetic or DNA testing. 1. Get to learn more about your family history A thorough grasp of the family history will always offer you some clues regarding the kind of testing that can benefit you the most. The propergenetic analysis testhelps in encouraging the family health history among men and women. It helps to determine if the health issues like any form of cancer even run in your family. In case they do, then generic counseling and testing will offer a better understanding of the risks that you might be facing and what to do about them. When you are gathering clues, be sure to see if there are heart diseases, cancer patterns, or other illnesses available to run through generations. Recognizing the inherited disease pattern can help the whole family. After you learnwhat is genetic test, you will realize the importance of looking into history on both sides of your family. 2. Pretty affordable and also covered by medical insurance plans Just a few years back, getting one of anytypes of genetic testingcan cost you a lot of money. But, thanks to advances taking place in DNA technologies, now you can get the test done at reduced rates. Laboratories are now offering DNA tests for the larger panels of genetic diseases. Furthermore, there are different insurance plans that will understand the major values of genetic testing and helps to prevent the onset of disease. These plans will offer the ultimate coverage for all the qualifying individuals. 3. Genetic counselors to help navigate the results Well, genetic counselors are mainly experts who are the main decision-makers aroundgenetic analysis test. They understand that every person has their set of life goals, values, and experiences. The current decision to go for genetic screening will involve multiple factors. It is quite helpful to have a direct chat about the pros and cons of such tests with a genetic counselor. The main goal of this discussion is to determine whether a screening test is a right option for you to consider. Some of the questions that might arise over here will include the reasons why you want the information, ways you are planning to take it to family members regarding implications, what you are planning to do with the results, and so on. In case you fail to visit a genetic counselor face to face, some labs will offer free telephone access to some of the board-certified professionals. With proper counseling, you will feel it easier to understand the DNA results and that helps you to make some informed health choices as well. 4. Carriers of the genetic diseases are mostly healthy You can always target those carriers as healthy individuals, who carry genetic diseases. Based on the kind of disease involved, a carrier can be healthy himself but unfortunately pass the disease to future generations, such as spinal muscular atrophy and cystic fibrosis. Once you have your answers resolved onwhat is genetic test, you will come to know its importance. In the case of some cancer types like hereditary colon cancer, the carrier seems to be prone to develop cancer during the early stages of life and then pass on propensity. Some of you might be a carrier of various rare diseases and you are not even aware of it unless you get tested. So, understand thetypes of genetic testingfirst and then go for the right one. If you have recessive diseases, then you might skip some generations. So, you are not sure if you are infected or not. For any kind of recessive disease to deal with, it is vital for both parents to carry the same rare gene. At some point, people would choose to not go for carrier screening as they don’t have a concerning history behind the family. But, you must know that around 80% of children, if not more, who are born with genetic diseases are both to those parents without any history of that disease in the family. 5. Using results to plan right ahead There are different times in life when agenetic analysis testwill help you to plan ahead and that helps in saving your life, especially if you have cancer running in your family. During pregnancy screening, a carrier screen will be performed on blood samples or saliva for both you and also your partner. That provides some useful ideas before conceiving. Over 100 rare yet significant genetic diseases will be added within the carrier screening like Hurler syndrome, Spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis, and even Wilson’s disease. Some such diseases on the carrier screening panel can get improved through some early interventions. It is because nutritional changes at birth can provide some value-added results later in life. So, it is not hard to state that understanding the risks through genetic testing, ahead of time, will give you ample time to prepare for the safety gear. You can start medications early or make changes in your diet plan to keep the disease at bay.

They are outstanding performers who significantly contribute to societys empowerment. Women are viewed as inferior to males not just in India but around the world, yet despite this, they strive to outperform them. Many Indian sportswomen have made an effort to liberate themselves from the constraints of prejudice, social exclusion, and cultural bias in order to build a successful careers for themselves. Female athletes have occupied an esteemed place in society by acquiring numerous roles other than being just a mother. They have finally received recognition as a result of their perseverance, hard work, and desire to prove themselves. Perhaps womens incredible progress is a wonderful result of their commitment and aspirations. Sports have the ability to transform lives. the capacity to promote gender equality by instilling in women and girls the values of cooperation, independence, fortitude, and self-assurance. Women who excel in athletics challenge gender conventions and prejudices, serve as positive role models, and promote equality for both sexes. Female athletes overcome all obstacles with their commitment and hard effort, despite the fact that males are more acclaimed and paid more than women. Sania Mirza, Mary Kom, Mithali Raj, PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal, and more athletes have made the country proud with their illustrious triumphs in a variety of sports. They have moved beyond the realm of athletics that was formerly controlled by males. The number of female athletes is always growing, and they are equally unmatched and unbeatable. Despite the rise in the number of female athletes in the sports sector. One of the main issues facing Indian society is gender equality, which is currently being addressed by a number of authorities and women as well. The salary gap between women athletes and their male counterparts, which is either half or less, is the biggest obstacle facing female competitors in sports. The earnings of men and women differ greatly, and the same is true of prize money. Aside from this, female athletes are less diverse than male athletes. The prospects for female athletes consistent income and job stability are grim. Women have little choice but to take up other work in order to supplement their income. Despite these obstacles, female athletes are pushing themselves to be the best versions of themselves and are making history. Nevertheless, there are a few outstanding female athletes who are revered and who have motivated the next generation to pursue their aspirations. Sania Mirza is the first and only female Indian tennis player to have captured six major championships. She has received the Padma Shri and Arjuna Awards. Many women have been motivated by her to showcase their abilities and go after their aspirations. MC Mary Kom, who experienced gender prejudice, became the only female boxer to take home medals in every amateur boxing division. She is an Olympic boxer from India also known as the Unbreakable. She has won the world amateur boxing title five times. Moreover, she was the only female boxer to medal in any of the six world championships. Mary Kom has received several honours, including the Padma Shri, the Arjuna Award for Boxing, and the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award. The first badminton player from India to earn an Olympic medal is Saina Nehwal. She is the first female and second Indian shuttler after Prakash Padukone to hold the top ranking in the world. She is credited with boosting badmintons appeal in India. For her accomplishments, she has received the Arjuna Award, Padma Shri, and Padma Bhushan. Indian cricketer Mithali Raj is the test and ODI captain of the womens national squad. She is the first female cricketer in womens one-day international matches to have scored more than 7,000 runs. She has received several national and international honours, including the Padma Shri from the Indian government in 2015 and the Wisden Leading Woman Cricketer in the World in 2017. She is one of the most well-known female players in the world. The first Indian to win the world championship in badminton is PV Sindhu. Only two Indian athletes have ever won back-to-back medals in the Olympics, Sindhu being the other. Sindu has received the Arjuna Award, the Padma Shri, and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. Women have battled their way out of the dominant society throughout the years. Since they never gave up, they have already attained their goal.

2024-04-27 22:34:42,science_education,Meet Nazanin Rastegradoost,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/meet-nazanin-rastegradoost,"Nazanin Rastegradoost is a Wireless Communications Specialist with Ofinno. Nazanin shared how her first experiences with astronomy in Tehran, Iran shaped her outlook on STEM and inevitably led her to pursue a career with Ofinno.  Smithsonian Science Education Center: What was your first memorable experience with STEM? Nazanin: When I was in middle school, I was immediately attracted to an after-school astronomy club. We took trips to observatories and deserts throughout Tehran, Iran to watch meteor showers, identify constellations, and learn about the sky. We even built a tent to simulate the night sky and painted various constellations on the fabric. How were you able to nurture your interests throughout middle and high school? Once I was exposed to my schools math center, and with my mom helping me solve equations, I became even more interested in science and math. I went to a great school and learned from top-level instructors, especially in mathematics. I became really interested in geography, which is used frequently in astronomy. We solved these classic geometry theorems that were challenging, but also really fun. They felt like puzzles to me, and I was determined to solve all of them. How did your teachers, mentors, or family members help you pursue your interests? How did you decide what to pursue for your college major? I was trying to make sense of my life as a teenager. When I was in high school, I snuck a cell phone into school and I started asking questions about how cell phones workedit was pretty basic technology at the time. I wanted to figure out how I could talk to someone remotely at any time without using a wired connection. When I finished high school and started to decide on a college major, I selected electrical engineering because it focused heavily on math and I could study wireless communication. At what point did you realize that you could turn your passions into a career? When I started consulting with people about a college major, I observed a friends sister who was a wireless communications engineer. She traveled to different areas to solve peoples problems, and I realized that engineering could use design and math to solve real-world problems to help people. Once I started taking the basic courses for electrical engineering, I was eager to know more. These questions led me to graduate studies and a research career. Graduate school was tough, but it was amazing to see how it changed my professional viewpoints. Seeing myself grow and learn more about solving real-world problems led me to a research career within the industry. Were living in an ever-evolving world, especially within communications. As a wireless specialist, I can see the gaps in our connectivity and develop ideas on how to solve them. Is there anyone that currently inspires you to continue working in this particular field? I have the best team here at Ofinno, and theyre my main inspiration. My husband and family are proud to see me progress in this area, and their support is important to me. Can you describe your career path that led you to working at Ofinno? The day of my PhD dissertation defense, my professor invited a former student who started his own company. The following day after my defense, he offered me a role as an intern with Ofinno and I accepted. This allowed me to continue what I was studying in my PhD program in a more industrial way. A few months later, I started working as a full-time employee. What does an average day look like for you? My job entails quite a bit of reading and critical thinking about enhancements for projects. My colleagues and I have brainstorming sessions to develop strategies to solve issues within wireless communications. We try to find the most important problem and shape solutions for them in an applicable way for the real world. We patent our ideas and if its adopted, your idea is implemented in the device.  ",664
2024-04-27 21:39:14,sports,The Regulation of Fantasy Sports in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/legal-shack/the-regulation-of-fantasy-sports-in-india-53547/,"Fantasy sports or fantasy gaming has gained popularity in recent years and mainly after the covid-19 outbreak occurred in the year 2020. The industry of fantasy gaming has boomed since then as the number of users has been rising at a very rapid pace. Before analyzing the industry and the laws regulating it one needs to know what fantasy gaming and fantasy sports are all about. FANTASY SPORTS Fantasy sports or known as rotisserie sport is a form of online game that is virtually played through performances of athletes in real life. The participants in a fantasy sport act as managers as they draft, trade, and select their own lineup of professional athletes. The participants can either play in free competitions or can also pay and win as per the amount of the contest. It is mainly an online prediction game based entirely on real-life sports matches. The participants can play against one or more participants. As per data released in February 2022 by the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS) and Deloitte (Deloitte, 2022), India has a market size of over INR 34,000 crore in the fantasy gaming industry. Buoyed by strategic investments the industry caters to over 13 crore registered users said the report. The report further said that 85% of the revenue is brought in through cricket. Football stood second with a 6.32% share. As per the FIFS estimates, the fantasy sports industry is estimated to grow to INR 1,65,000 in the fiscal year 2025.Since the fantasy sports industry is on a boom and has seen rapid expansion over the past few years its regulation has also been difficult. Different states have different laws regarding these which create confusion among the masses regarding its regulation. GAMBLING & BETTINGOne of the main issues which arise about fantasy sports is whether they can be considered as an act of gambling or betting. A simple definition of betting is the act of staking a wagering sum or amount which can be in the form of cash or any asset on the assumption that an eventwill occur or not. As stated by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Dr. K. R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu & Anr.32i, Gambling in a nut-shell is the payment of a price for a chance to win a prize. Games may be of chance, or of skill, or of skill and chance combined. A game of chance is determined entirely or in part by lot or mere luck. In these games, the result is wholly uncertain and doubtful. A game of skill, on the other hand  although the element of chance necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated  is one in which success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience, and adroitness of the player.The Public Gambling Act, 1867 was introduced before the introduction of the Constitution of India. It prohibited public gambling and the keeping of common gaming houses but made an exception for games of skill. But after the promulgation of the constitution, the issues pertaining to gambling and betting were stated under Entry 34 of the state list. It meant that from now on, only the state legislature can make laws regarding these issues. DEVELOPMENTS  Odisha banned all types of online gaming apps under the Odisha Prevention of Gambling Act, 1955. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh has also banned fantasy gaming apps such as Dream 11 through the Andhra Pradesh Gaming Act of 1974. In order to make online gaming illegal, the Telangana cabinet enacted an ordinance in 2017 that amended the 1974 Telangana Gaming Act.  Assamese citizens are also not permitted to use online fantasy sports platforms such as MPL and Dream 11 as they are banned in Assam.  In the year 2021, the Kerala High Court issued a notice to Virat Kohli and other celebrities for promoting online rummy games and other fantasy sports. GAME OF SKILL vs GAME OF CHANCE Games of skill are identified as a separate category from the games of chance as it is not totally dependent upon the certainty of an event. In a game of skill, the skill factor predominates over the luck factor which is the opposite in the case of a game of chance. It does not depend on sheer luck. It includes strategies, talent, skills, team formation, player selectionetc. Whereas in a game of chance, winning is totally dependent upon luck and does not include strategies, team selection, etc. It is comparatively easy than a game of skill.Fantasy sports are considered as a game of skill as it includes the formation of strategies and other skills such as knowledge about players which are not required in a game of chance. The Punjab and Haryana High Court in 2017, in the case of Shri Varun Gumber v. Union Territory of Chandigarh and Orsii held that fantasy sports predominantly include the skill factor hence they cannot be considered as a game of chance. The Rajasthan High Court and the Bombay High Court too have considered fantasy sports as a game of skill. REGULATION The Supreme Court in September 2022 rejected a special leave petition filed by Avinash Mehrotra challenging the legality of fantasy sports in India. Rejecting the PIL the Supreme Court stated that Fantasy sports such as Dream 11 are a game of skill and are protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution. The Rajasthan High Court also recently in 2023 observed that online gaming is not betting or gambling and granted interim relief to an online gaming platform named Myteam 11.Fantasy gaming is not directly mentioned in The Indian Constitution but The Supreme Court has time and again held that it is part of Article 19(1)(g). The article reads as follows: to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business This article provides citizens the fundamental right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business. However, activities such as gambling do not come under the scope of this article as stated by the Supreme Court in State of Bombay v. Chamarbaugwalaiii. Hence fantasy games not being an act of gambling or betting, will be covered under Article 19(1)(g) and shall be protected by the government. CONCLUSION As pronounced by various courts in various cases, the debate over fantasy sports being a game of skill or a game of chance is well settled. Hence wasting time over this will result in losing an opportunity by not focusing on the booming industry of Fantasy Sports.The fantasy gaming industry is creating and will create many opportunities which can be utilized for growth.The way forward from here is to create a particular law that deals with all the fantasy gaming apps and sports, which will ultimately result in a more efficient regulation of this industry.",1137
2024-04-27 21:14:56,disease_symptoms,How a Complete Blood Test Can Help You Improve Your Health?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/how-a-complete-blood-test-can-help-you-improve-your-health/,"Did you know that an easy blood test can reveal more about your health than most doctors? The blood tests your doctor orders are vital to the diagnosis. Your lab results allow physicians to evaluate organ function and detect any blood-borne diseases or abnormalities. Learn all about thecomplete blood count(CBC) here. What is the Complete Blood Count (CBC) Test? A complete blood count (CBC) is ablood testthat checks for changes in the blood. It gives information about the types and numbers of cells in your blood. The test will measure the number of Red blood cells White blood cells and Platelets present in your bloodstream These three components play important roles in different functions in your body. If any of them is within normal ranges, the corresponding function will be handled efficiently. Low or high counts of these cells indicate a dysfunction or disease. A CBC also shows how well your bone marrow produces healthy blood cells. Everyone has these cells, but certain changes in their numbers can indicate a health problem. What is it used for? The CBC is used to test severaldifferent types of anemia. It can be used to monitor specific conditions such as cancer and heart failure. Hemoglobin levels, or red blood cell count, are also tested to see if the body has enough healthyred blood cells. Platelet levels are also checked to see if there is an adequate level of platelets being produced by the bone marrow. Why do I need a complete blood count? If you have signs or symptoms of infection, your doctor may order a CBC as part of a routine physical exam. It may be ordered if you are being tested for other liver function problems or kidney function problems. A complete blood count is also ordered when you have symptoms that suggest a problem with your blood or if you have a condition that affects your blood cells (such as sickle cell disease). What happens during a Complete Blood Count test? As a part of the procedure, performed by qualifiedphlebotomists or lab techniciansdraw required blood from the superficial veins of the upper arm using a syringe and transfer it to a test tube or a vial. The specimen will then be sent to the lab for analysis. The amount of blood taken depends on how many tests you’re having done, but it’s usually about 1mL to 3mL. In most cases, you do not need to fast before having this test done. You may eat or drink normally before the test. However, it is advised to drink plenty of water before your appointment. When you’re hydrated, your blood volume goes up, and your veins are plumper and easier to access. The purpose of a Complete Blood Count For overall health assessment of the patient: It is often recommended as part of a complete medical examination to obtain a CBC to get a complete picture of a patient’s health. This will help your doctor identify any potential health issues you may have. Diagnose medical conditions: If you are ill, your doctor will perform a CBC to determine the cause or etiology of your illness and determine yourWBC count. . Typically, this is done when the patient is experiencing symptoms of fatigue, fever, weakness, or even internal bleeding. Monitoring a medical treatment’s effectiveness: A CBC can only be used to monitor specific treatments. Counting your blood cells and white blood cells (RBCs & WBCs) allows the doctors to monitor how well the treatment works. To monitor your health: If you suffer from a medical condition that affects your blood, your doctor may recommend a CBC test to check your blood cell count. Your doctor may prescribe medication or dietary changes to manage the condition. What does a CBC measure? Thecomplete blood count (CBC)is one of the most common tests performed in a doctor’s office or hospital. It measuresred and white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin. Red blood cells are the most abundant type of blood cell and carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues. Your body’s amount of red blood cells depends on your age and sex. This test measures your level of red blood cells. White blood cells are essential for fighting infections, protecting against disease, and healing wounds. There are five different types of white blood cells:neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. You can determine how many white blood cells you have by taking this test. Platelets help prevent bleeding by forming clots at sites where vessels have been injured or damaged. If you lose too many platelets, you could bleed excessively after an injury or surgery. This test measures how many platelets you have per microliter of blood (microliters). Hemoglobin is the protein in your blood that holds oxygen. The test determines the Hb level of the patient and the HbA1C level of blood glucose to determine if the patient is not suffering from pre-diabetes. A red blood cell scale is used to measure the size of the RBC. The size of these cells provides significant information about the patient’s medical condition. A high MCV indicates low folate orvitamin B12levels if your cells are larger than usual. If the size is smaller, this may be a sign of anemia. A doctor can determine how many red cells are present in your blood by measuring this. Low percentages may indicate iron deficiency. The mineral iron is responsible for thered blood cell count. However, if your score is high, you may be dehydrated or suffering from another condition or disorder. What does the result indicate? CBCs measure the number of cells in your blood. If your counts are not within normal ranges, there may be several reasons. These include: Hematocrit or red blood cell levels that are abnormal can be signs ofanemia, heart disease, or low iron levels. White cell count may be low due to certainautoimmune disorders, bone marrow disorders, or cancer. A high white blood cell count could result from an infection or an adverse reaction to medicine. When your levels are abnormal, it does not always mean you have a medical problem that requires treatment. Diet, activity level, medicine, menstruation, and not drinking enough water can affect the results. CBCS is useful for evaluating an individual’s overall health. CBCs are associated with very low or no risks. There is only one procedure that involves taking a blood sample from the patient. By the results of this blood test, the next phase of treatment can be determined. Present in 9 locations across 8 major cities in India,  Dr. Remedies Labs offersCompleteBlood Count testsas a part of its various packages at affordable prices. On taking an appointment, qualified phlebotomists will visit your residence or office to collect the samples and revert with the reports by email.

2024-04-27 22:34:43,science_education,5 Takeaways as a Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Intern,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/5-takeaways-smithsonian-science-global-goals-intern,"Just a few months ago, I was scouring the Internet as a high school senior, trying to find a way to spend my summer before starting my freshman year of college. I have always been drawn to the Smithsonian, from its thriving museums and centers that share ideas to the expansive network of researchers creating new knowledge. I knew I wanted to contribute to this amazing community before I left the greater Washington D.C. Area. I was thrilled to participate as a summer intern with the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC). Now that my internship is drawing to an end (sadly!) I have five takeaways I learned from my experience as a Smithsonian Science for Global Goals intern working on the Biotechnology! community research guide. Whether youre an aspiring SSEC intern, incoming college freshman, or anywhere in between, I hope this can be helpful. 1. Try something new. Exploring unexplored interests can be exciting yet nerve-wracking. Before SSEC, I had done work in STEM education, lab research, public speaking, and writing. But I had never really had an experience that tied my interdisciplinary interests together. In joining the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Team, I could simultaneously explore the field of STEM curriculum development while also diving into new topics like biotechnology in agriculture and the environment that I might have never thought to explore. My nervousness in this uncharted territory was alleviated by the fact that my life will probably only get busier from here on out; if not now, when? 2. Do your background research. Ever see something and go, Wow, I have no idea what this is? That was me pretty much every day during my internship! But only because I was discovering so much new information each day. I found that in order to translate high level material into the simplified language needed for student-facing materials, you must first become a high level expert yourself. Know that its okay if you dont know things now, but take notes and stockpile resources along the way. Youll thank yourself later! 3. Diverse teamwork makes the dream work. Diversity of backgrounds and ideas makes a concept stronger. While researching a part of the Biotechnology! guide on the environment, I had an unforgettable discussion with Smithsonian researcher and coral expert Dr. Mary Hagedorn. She used the example of diversity in humans as a tool to help students understand the importance of biodiversity in ecosystems. Differences in backgrounds and ideas make a society stronger, just like biodiversity makes an ecosystem stronger. A simple concept, sure, but its true! As I worked with other interns from around the United States and the globe, I got to hear perspectives that I had never heard before. This helped make my work more inclusive and thoughtful. I always walked away from each brainstorming session having gone a step further conceptually and learned something new. 4. Thinking takes time. Nevertheless, there will be a period where youre trying to find a clear path within all the wonderful ideas you have. Attending a staff Lesson Jam, which is a brainstorming session where all of SSEC comes together to hash out a specific idea, illustrated this process to me. For 30 minutes, a group of highly-educated adults talked about everything from the solubility of Kool-Aid to what scenario we should use for a math problem. Although we didnt pin down one idea at the end, Im confident that that conversation helped create the final product, and I had a lot of fun. Brainstorming can be a worthwhile challenge that you dont have to tackle on your own. 5. Enjoy the process! I will never forget the camaraderie that happened in between the lines during SSEC: diving into tangents on carbon sequestration and cloning in a one-on-one advisor meeting; bonding over high school life in an intern hangout after work; and fellow interns hyping each other up for our individual successes. While I may have had a lot going on this summer (working, moving, and the pre-frosh grind included) I always looked forward to anything SSEC related. Every connection I made has shaped me into someone who will continue to discover, understand, and act for a lifetime.",698
2024-04-27 21:39:23,sports,Indias Tryst With Sports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/entropy/indias-tryst-with-sports-54372/,"As India frenzies in its biggest annual sporting extravaganza, the Indian Premier League, two parts of the broadcast on the live stream, in particular, caught my attention. Amidst all the drama of the tournament and the crores of views it generated in the nearly 8 weeks the superstars of the cricketing world put on a breathtaking display of sporting excellence, it was an advertisement featuring Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh that took the cake in pushing the agenda for sports in India. The advertisement featuring the aforementioned legends of Indian cricket acted in a campaign in which they would watch India take on teams in different, oft-ignored sports in this country. Cadburys #CheerForAllSports couldnt come at a better time for all of us, it sheds light on the sheer overpowering support for cricket at the cost of virtually every other sport. As the IPL reaches its climax and millions of sports fans in India go searching for something new to entertain themselves in the evenings and weekends that were spent watching cricket, the Cadbury ads message could prove to be the change that drives all sports to achieve some level of parity with Indias most popular sport. Yuvraj and Harbhajan celebrating Indias success on the screen might not in itself drive the masses to suddenly develop an interest in the multitude of sporting successes in the country but it certainly pokes and prods at peoples general ignorance of the lack of interest in them and how it translates to their growth and development. In this article, I delve into a few examples which make my point about these sportspersons not getting their deserved plaudits To start with a more positive situation with respect to general medias coverage and peoples interest, the recent protests against Indian wrestlings governing body and its upper management have been extensively in the news. While promising that other sports personalities are warranting a few headlines in mainstream media, it is worth questioning if it is because these medal-winning wrestlers are only in the news because of the nature of the news. The scandal behind a political partys leaders alleged actions might be pushing it more into the limelight than the identity of the victims. If the same were to happen in a completely irrelevant(w.r.t sports) governing body, per se, rural development, it might warrant almost as much attention. All this in the grand scheme of things makes for a very morbid reading. Sportsmen and women whose achievements are generally ignored unless they win Olympic medals for the country shouldnt be the normal state of affairs in the country. PV Sindhu might have won medals for India in the Olympics, but her fellow badminton player Kashyap Sen reached the finals of the All England Open, Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand remain the only Indians to have won it, and if you were to ask most people they would blink and shrug at the achievement and put it out of their mind and his achievement would go unrecognized. Sunil Chettri is fifth in the list of most goals scored by a player for their national team in world football and he did this while playing for an Indian team which isnt anywhere near the pinnacle of the sport, yet it is only brought up to slight Lionel Messi for the brief time Chettri was ahead in the list. All this is to say, please wake up my fellow countrymen, if we want to celebrate more success in the Olympics, they deserve a lot more followers. More support and interest generate more revenue by way of sponsorships, stadium income and tv rights, which directly leads to more money circulating in the sport and better facilities and amenities for them. Indias quest for glory often starts when these sportspeople are still toddlers, not when theyre playing in the semi-finals or the finals of the Olympics. They need more from us in the years leading up to the Olympics than the one day they actually take part in it. Lets cheer them on for a few years and see where it takes us instead of the few days we tend to do it. Signing off, an avid sports fan and a hypocrite trying to live up to his own words.",709
2024-04-27 21:14:56,disease_symptoms,"PCOS in women: its effects, symptoms, and lifestyle changes to overcome￼",https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/pcos-in-women/,"Nowadays, lifestyle changes are causing abnormalities in women’s periodic cycles, which later become symptoms of lifestyle diseases. These diseases are hormonal balance issues, thyroid disorders,polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), etc. The effects of PCOS, their long-term consequences, and the symptoms to recognize them will be discussed in this article. It is essential to know the long-term health risks associated withpolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) to make the appropriate decision regarding your health. Infertility or subfertility Endometrial cancer Diabetes Lipid abnormalities Cardiovascular risks Obstructive sleep apnea Although PCOS does not cause these conditions in all women, it increases your risk of developing them. Therefore, it is imperative to see a physician who has experience treating women with PCOS regularly to keep track of your health. It is essential to see a physician regularly throughout your reproductive years and even after menopause. This is even if you no longer have irregular periods and othersymptoms of PCOSlessen. Many thousands of women with PCOS are treated for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome every year. PCOS Effects and Risks that may occur Often, women who cannot get pregnant are not aware that they have PCOS until they see their doctor.Women with PCOSmay have infertility (reduced fertility). A hormonal imbalance caused by an overproduction of testosterone could explain this. Sometimes, ova (eggs) are not released from the ovaries. Assisted reproductive technologies and ovulation-inducing drugs have made it possible for many women with PCOS to conceive. Even though PCOS lowers a woman’s chances of getting pregnant, the disease is not a substitute for birth control. Despite the condition, many women can conceive naturally without medical assistance. Contraceptives are recommended for women who are sexually active and do not wish to become pregnant. Endometrial cancer (which can occur at the lining of the uterus) appears as the highest risk for women with PCOS in the latter part of their life. Women of all age groups experience a monthly buildup of the endometrial lining in the uterus. The lining is normally shed at ovulation in the case of non-pregnant women. It is the process of preparing the body to gain the potential for a fertilized egg. Though there is an experience of the monthly buildup of the endometrial lining, due to the infrequent or nonexistent menstrual periods in women with PCOS, the lining is not shed sufficiently. Thus the lining continuously builds and will increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Sugar (glucose) is metabolized or processed by the body with the help of insulin. Impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance has been linked to PCOS. In addition, PCOS is aggravated by high levels of insulin, which stimulate testosterone production. Up to40% of women with PCOShave abnormal glucose tolerance by age 40, either diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. 4. Lipid Abnormalities Women with PCOS are at risk for having unfavorable lipid profiles due to hyperandrogenism (increased testosterone). As a result, a woman with PCOS may have a high level of fat substances in her bloodstream. The blood lipid profile of some women may show a lower percentage of high-density lipoproteins (HDL, the “good” cholesterol) and a more significant percentage of low-density lipoproteins (LDL, the “bad” cholesterol). As a result of this imbalance, cardiovascular disease is more likely to occur. PCOS is associated with an increased risk for heart disease and othercardiovascular diseases in women. The tendency for women with PCOS to be overweight increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, just as obesity increases cardiovascular disease risk for women and men without PCOS. Several studies have confirmed that women with PCOS are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Increased body weight on this risk is apparent, but women with PCOS are also at high risk. The high testosterone levels in PCOS may also contribute to the development of sleep apnea. Dr. Remedies Labsoffers a package for women to determine if they have PCOS, lipid profiles, cholesterol values, diabetes, and other issues. Other checkups are even included in the package, such as thyroid profile, arthritic risk, etc. For regular checkups to enhance your lifestyle orPCOS problems, please browse ourRemedies Labsand get checked up at an affordable price.",680
2024-04-27 22:34:46,science_education,Adapting to Change: Benefits of Inquiry-Based Science Education for Students and Teachers,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/adapting-change-benefits-inquiry-based-science-education-students-and-teachers,"In October of 2019, the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) was awarded an early-phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR) grantfrom the U.S. Department of Education. We were excited to begin our project providing Smithsonian Science for the Classroom curriculum and professional development to teachers. How could we have predicted that mere months later a global pandemic would wreak havoc on classroom learning worldwide? When schools abruptly and indefinitely closed their doors in March 2020, our project bringing inquiry-based science curriculum to third, fourthand fifth-grade students in rural North and South Carolina was turned upside down, along with everything else. Our best-laid plans to understand howSmithsonian Science for the Classroomcurriculum and robust professional development (PD) impact student achievement in science, math, and reading suddenly seemed like a far-off dream. When we finally launched our first workshop in the spring of 2021, it was with renewed purpose to combat learning loss and build connections.  The PD we held in March 2021 was completely reimagined for our new normal of online convenings, and much different from the big kick-off in-person introduction we had planned. Teachers were, understandably, swamped trying to serve students who might be in the classroom one day and at home the next. Despite these challenges, weve seen teachers confidence in their science instruction grow over the past three years, first in the virtual environment and then when we resumed in-person PD. Does change like this happen overnight? Absolutely not! But just as our workshops have evolved to meet changing needs, so have teachers attitudes. By our last PD in summer 2023, we received positive feedback from teachers and participants in the program, WOW! I was so engaged in these PD lessons and feel more empowered to take on instruction on these new 4th grade science standards. At the start of our most recent Content and Pedagogy Professional Development, we asked teachers when they last took a chemistry or physics class. Some couldnt remember if they ever took one, while others mentioned a class 10+ years ago. Although there was some apprehension about not being subject-matter experts, teachers asked questions, shared their classroom knowledge and werent afraid to be vulnerable. During the workshop, teachers participated in activities and simulations to address misconceptions and explore different teaching strategies. By the end of our two days together, teachers felt energized and confident in themselves and their ability to guide learning alongside their students.  To better understand the effect on students, our third-party evaluator, the Center for Research in Educational Policy (CREP) at the University of Memphis, is currently analyzing student assessment data. We eagerly await a better understanding of the impact of Smithsonian Science for the Classroom curriculum and accompanying professional development on student achievement in science, math and reading. While were excited the preliminary analysis is very positive, the project has bolstered more than students scores. Weve seen teachers attitudes and confidence related to science learning and instruction bloom and directly translate to students excitement about science. The curriculum is very engaging to the students. They love the hands-on activities, they take leadership while working in groups, theyre pulled into discovery and the joy of the discovery when they do the experiments, said Andrea Walter from Polk Central Elementary School. They also enjoy the reading selections because it brings a global perspective to their lives and they make connections to what theyre learning in social studies. While the Smithsonian Science Education Center and our incredible collaborators might not have known what was in store when awarded the grant in 2019, we have made the most of the opportunity to serve teachers and students in rural districts across North and South Carolina. The fact that all 37 of the schools who first signed on to participate have remained in the project is a testament to their tenacity and resilience as much as it is the resources we have to offer. We look forward to sharing more with supporters after the official publication of the analysis and, until then, continue to showcase the holistic benefits of inquiry-based science education on student outcomes.",678

2024-04-27 21:14:57,disease_symptoms,Women’s Health Package – An assortment of tests,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/womens-health-package-an-assortment-of-tests/,"Womenplay a crucial role in creating families. When they are healthy, families can thrive. In the 30s, women usually tend to lose bone density. In some women, hemoglobin deficiency may occur. Taking time to exercise, manage stress, and eat right are essential habits for every woman. Routine health screenings are among these habits, which can detect problems at an early stage. Getting screened regularly could even save your life. You can prevent complications and increase your quality of life when you detect disease early. This will improve and change the course of your life. Women diagnosed with early cancers have recovered after undergoing treatment in many cases. Women need some special examinations to be undergone because, though various health conditions affect both men and women, some affect women more often and differently. Most drug trials fail to include female test subjects, and many conditions that affect women go undiagnosed. However,some health concerns are exclusive to women, such asbreast cancer, cervical cancer, menopause, and pregnancy. Heart attacks and urinary tract infections are more common in women than men. Women are also more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety disorders than men. The below-mentioned illnesses are more prevalent among women. Heart Diseases Women are more at risk of developing heart disease than men. However, many of them are unaware of the threat.Heart attacksare more likely to occur if you suffer fromhigh blood pressure or cholesterol issues.Check-up is mandatoryto avoid the risk of threat. Breast cancer Usually originating in the milk duct lining,breast cancercan spread to other organs and is the most aggressive cancer in females worldwide. Developed nations have a higher prevalence of this condition among their female populations due to their longer life expectancies. Breast cancer patientsare likely to developlumps in their breasts. Breast lumps are often harmless, but women should have each one checked by a healthcare professional. Ovarian and cervical cancer Most of us are unaware of the differences between ovarian cancer and cervical cancer.Cervical cancerdevelops in thelower uterus, whileovarian cancerdevelops in thefallopian tubes. In both cases, the pain is unbearable. It is possible todetect cervical cancer by a pap smear, whereasovarian cancer requires more tests. This disease manifests in vague symptoms that should be considered seriously. Gynecological Health It is natural forwomento experience bleeding and discharge during theirmenstrual cycle. It is important to note that additional symptoms during menstruation may indicate health issues and that unintended symptoms, such asbleedingbetweenmenstruations and frequent urination, can indicate otherhealth problems. There could also be reproductive system disorders involving the vaginal area, such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Even though some infections are easily treated, they can lead to severe conditions like infertility and kidney failure if left untreated. Pregnancy Issues Pre-existing conditions can worsen the condition duringpregnancy. It sometimes threatens the health of the mother and the child. If asthma, diabetes, or depression are not appropriately managed, they can harm both mother and child.A mother’s red blood cell count may drop due to anemia during pregnancy.The implantation of a reproductive cell outside the uterus also makes further pregnancy difficult. It is also problematic when a reproductive cell implants outside the uterus, making further gestation impossible.Obstetriciansare able to manage and treat a wide range of medical conditions during pregnancy. Autoimmune diseases When viruses attack healthy cells,autoimmune diseasesoccur. As this condition continues to escalate, it is astonishing to learn that women are mostly affected by such diseases. A common symptom of such autoimmune diseases is exhaustion, mild fever, pain, skin irritation, and vertigo. All these autoimmune diseases originate from the stomach, as most of the autoimmune system rests there. So people who suffer from these conditions have to adapt tonatural healing practiceslikereducingsugar intake, fat intake, avoiding toxic food, Lowering stress, etc.; we can defend against it by early detection. Osteoporosisis another condition in women which weakens the bones, allowing them to break easily. Several other factors that cause the condition in women mostly are age, specific prescriptions, usage of steroids, genetics, lack of exercise, Low body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, etc., Depression and anxiety Depression and anxietycan result fromnatural hormonal fluctuations.Premenstrual syndrome(PMS) is common among women, whilepremenstrual dysmorphic disorder(PMDD) presents similar symptoms but is greatly intensified. Mothers often experience the “baby blues” following childbirth, butperinatal depressionis more severe, causing concerns, emotional shifts, sadness, and fatigue. Menopause and perimenopause cause depression. Providers can provide relief from symptoms, regardless of how severe they are, with a prescription or therapeutic treatments.

Read theprevious installmentin this blog series here. Carmelina Livingston is a Lead Education Specialist atSolutions in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (STEM Centers SC)and formerly an elementary and informal educator. She has attended and facilitated professional development for third grade teachers in South Carolina on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom modulesHow Can We Protect Animals When Their Habitat Changes?in March and August 2021 andHow Can We Predict Patterns of Motion?in summer 2022. We spoke with Carmelina in 2021 after virtual professional development to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: Why is science education important to you? Carmelina: Well, its always been important to me. Its actually the backbone of everything I do! Science is an integral part of everyday living, such as weather and how we use weather, medicine, when earthquakes happen, getting food sources from agriculture, designing useful technology to assist in gathering data for us to have knowledge, but also have application in our world. This is essential for us to see the connection to science facts and theories and apply this information to everyday living. SSEC: What would you describe as your most memorable moment during the professional development sessions? Carmelina: The most memorable moments happened when teachers would learn new content and information and then demonstrate their understanding in creative and engaging ways. I love to see them have these moments of realization and how their passion after learning new information translates into their own instruction. SSEC:How has participating in and also leading professional development onSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacted your own practice? Carmelina:Its all about the connections to the joy of teaching and getting the chance to reflect with teachers on their classroom instruction by sharing ideas on strategies, assessment, student engagement, and supplemental resources that would complement instruction. I have gained so much by working together online with the teachers to explore scientific phenomenon and content and then putting it into practice by facilitating fun, engaging, inquiry, and standards-based lessons with students. In this screenshot from PD, Carmelina facilitates a conversation with teachers using padlet about the red-cockaded woodpecker. SSEC: What type of support does this give teachers as they go through these types of experiences? Carmelina:I really like that teachers not only learn about curricular resources that are standards-based, engaging, and inquiry-based, but they also get a chance to do the activities and learn from one other. The teachers that I worked with exchanged great ideas with other teachers about how to approach different lessons and were very receptive to learning from each other. SSEC: How do you seeSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacting the practice of South Carolina teachers? Carmelina: South Carolina teachers will benefit greatly by having these modules available in their classrooms because all investigations are standards-based and highly engaging. The lessons are also adaptable to both physical and virtual classroom settings and enable teachers and their students to investigate science phenomena together. SSEC: What are the benefits to students experiencingSmithsonian Science for the Classroommodules? Carmelina: Students will benefit greatly because teachers have practiced the lessons with their peers prior to using the module materials and resources. If teachers consistently experience the best practices in science instruction and have a chance to learn and reflect with their peer teachers, then you will see exemplary science instruction and student achievement in the classrooms.",586

Tiger Woods at 46,the15 time major golf champion and widely regarded as one of the best golfers and athletes of all time remains still an active pro- golfer after multiple life -threatening injuries. Roger Federer at 36, the tennis legend tied to both greatness and longevity was the first male tennis player to win 20 Grand Slam tennis tournaments only to be upstaged by both his fellow compatriots cum rivals Rafael Nadal 36 and Novak Djokovic 35 are tied at 22 Grand Slams each and still looking good for a couple of more seasons. JIMMY ANDERSON at 40, the English archimage of swing bowling who captured 600 wickets as the first ever fast bowler in the history of the game on 25 August 2020 still continues to be a force to reckon with in international cricket. Sachin Tendulkar, arguably the worlds greatest batsman played his 200th Test match at the age of FORTY and amassed a world record of 15,921 runs. Serena Williams quit when she was all of FORTY after winning a record number of 23 singles Grand Slam titles and a combined total of 39 Grand Slams (singles & doubles/mixed), the most in an Open Era by any tennis player. Lionel Messi, the dream merchant who famously lived upto his dream of winning the World Cup for the Les Albiceleste prior to his retirement was 35 years old at Qatar (November 2022) with a two- decade old international career already behind him. And only last week. LEBRON JAMES 38,the NBA professional and hoopster from Los Angeles Lakers connected a step back jumper to score a world record by taking his career total to a staggering 38,388 points in a two decade long journey to become the highest scorer in NBA professional history, eclipsing a record that had stood for close to four decades (courtesy Kareem Abdul Jabbar) . This record not only has class written all over it but exemplifies an athletes resounding skill, talent, speed, stamina and endurance combined with the fine art of balancing ones family life and a sporting career extraordinary. That Lebrons is a numero-uno sporting record can only be possibly guaged in terms of its unique achievement and magnitude with another unique record which even till date after 39 years still remains unbroken, when one unassuming 32  years old from then Czech Republic, Jarmila Kratochvilova last lap burst shattered the 800 metres world record with a world record winning time of 1min 53.28 secs at the Helsinki World Championships in 1983. That Jarmila also won the 400 metres with another world record time (later broken) is what transcends these athletes from mortal sportspersons to immortal dream merchants. Only, Oksana Chusovitina 47, an eponymous skilled gymnast who represented four former countries (now still representing Uzbekistan) has redefined her sport and has no peers in her sporting odyssey which spans EIGHT consecutive OLYMPICS. Closer home our very own Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami, Sania Mirza, an Anil Kumble have all had a dream run over their illustrious career of nearly two decades and called it a day on the wrong side of THIRTY after being champion players. Laender Paes, finally hung his racquet at the age of FORTY- SEVEN having won a record 18 Grand Slam titles in doubles and mixed doubles Needless to say, all of them have but one thing in common- the pure passion for the sport they played and which made them conquer dizzying heights of glory and fame in their respective professional career. They were and will remain the ultimate dream merchants of their respective sport. Their mantra  LONGEVITY FOR SUCCESS AND GREATNESS. Two decades in any sport at the highest- level calls for supreme physical fitness, mental endurance, motivation, balancing ones personal life with their passion and above all the support of fans, family& kids and own pro-team. Sportspersons are born to attain success or failure and successful athletes are those who last long to chase their goals unmindful of failures, super successful amongst them last longer till they realise their own dream(s) and to become part of sporting folklore. As sports lovers and fans, we could not have dreamt anything better as the age of super dads and super moms has well and truly arrived. ",763
2024-04-27 21:14:58,disease_symptoms,10 Things to Know Before Selecting a Diagnostic Center,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/10-things-to-know-before-selecting-a-diagnostic-center/,"Are you looking for a diagnostic center to diagnose your child or family?Diagnostic centersare necessary for determining the health problem. It’s a place that accounts for any health issues and provides treatment if needed. A diagnostic center performs various tests to determine the cause of the condition. There are different types of labs within this category, including radiology & MRI centers, imaging centers, pathology labs, etc. Do you know what questions to ask when checking a diagnostic center? Choosing thebest diagnostic centercan be confusing when you don’t know what questions to ask. Learn how to choose the best diagnostic center based on the doctors who’ve been there and on other features. There are several essential factors to consider before selecting the best Diagnostic center: 1. Qualification of the medical staff A diagnostic center should have a qualified medical staff to handle your health issues. The center should have experienced and skilledradiologists, pathologists, surgeons, and other medical professionals. The doctors are highly qualified and experienced in their specialty. They also have enough knowledge about different tests and procedures to be followed when treating an individual. The most important thing is to ensure that the doctor you choose has a license to practice medicine in your state. This license allows them to treat patients legally and prescribe medicines according to their needs. 2. Availability of the latest equipment All diagnostic centers use advanced technology for their services. You should check whether the facility has the latest equipment or not. If it does not, then you cannot expect high-quality results from them. 3. Ambiance and hygiene Every diagnostic center must follow proper hygiene while providing its services. If they do not follow these measures, there is a risk of infection among patients and medical professionals working at the facility. Therefore, make sure that they follow all safety measures while performing their tests on patients! 4. Quality of the services It is essential to look at what kind of quality services your preferred diagnostic center offers for its patients to ensure that it will meet all your needs. Make sure that the facility provides excellent care and attention to its patients. 5. Range and availability of tests The diagnostic center should be familiar with all types of diagnostic testing and procedures required to diagnose various diseases or conditions. It should provide a wide range of tests, includingblood tests, urine tests, X-rays, etc., which can help identify various diseases in children such as diabetes, cancer, thyroid disorders, and more. Make sure that there is no delay for these tests as they may be required at short notice due to an emergency or sudden change in your child’s health condition. 6. Ease of scheduling an appointment It is imperative that you can schedule an appointment quickly at the diagnostic center without having to wait for a long time or keep calling back repeatedly until someone is available. They should assist you with all your questions about scheduling appointments for yourself or your children and any other related queries that may arise during this process, for instance, payment options. 7. Accuracy in test results You must check the accuracy of results before choosing any diagnostic center because it is vital if you are planning on taking any medication after receiving these results from them and from other clinics, hospitals, or laboratories where they send samples for examination. 8. Turnaround time for test results delivery They should be able to provide you with accurate results within a short period of time so that you don’t have to wait for weeks or months before getting your results back from them or another medical institute or hospital where they send the samples for further examination and treatment if necessary based on those results. 9. Pricing and payment facilities across various diagnostic centers You need to understand how much each test costs at the diagnostic center before deciding where to go for testing. The best way to find out about this information is by asking them directly about it or by checking for yourself online or on other websites so that you don’t get overcharged for your tests when you go there. 10. Experience and customer reviews Another thing to consider when choosing a diagnostic center is its reputation and experience. It’s essential that the center has been around for some time and has a good track record for treating patients with similar conditions as yours. This shows that they have successfully treated other patients with similar conditions and, therefore, can give you confidence in their ability to treat yours too! The best way to check out their reputation is by searching online reviews, especially those posted by former patients who have used them before The cost of the services offered by the center should also be considered. You need to know that not all diagnostic centers are the same. Some offer high-quality services while others do not. This is why you must make sure that you consider all these factors before choosing an appropriate diagnostic center for your needs. Dr. Remedies Labsprovides such high-quality services. It is one of the best diagnostic centers in India. They offer all sorts of health checks and lab tests at a better price than other diagnostic centers in the area.  For this reason, the effects of its services have been just satisfying for those who visited us.

Flipping through photo albums as a child, Shannon Brogdon-Grantham discovered the stories of relatives from the past she never got to meet. Its this activity that inspired her to go after a career as a photo conservator at the Smithsonians Museum Conservation Institute. We always had the family photo albums out at the holidays to look through them. I really got to know a lot of my relatives through photography, Shannon said, I always thought it was really cool that you could see someone from the past and be connected with them. She began college with thinking about a job in forensic medicine, which is the usage of medical knowledge to figure out how a person mightve been hurt during a crime, but she realized her heart was set on a different calling. She switched majors and began to study art history. Thats when she learned about the field of photographic conservation. Even though most people might think of photographs in a photo album, pictures are very important for lots of other reasons. Just like artwork and fossils are clues into the past experiences of people and animals, photographs help tell the stories of people from years ago. By protecting and conserving photos, Shannon can help provide people with important information about the lives of people from different times and places.  Shannon loved science from a young age. She especially loved dissecting an owl pellet, or poop, during class in fourth grade. It was a little gross, but to her, it was mostly exciting. As disgusting as that is, it was really cool, and I was hooked ever since then with science, she explained, I went to a specialty high school that was health sciences and engineering. So, thats when my interest in medicine took hold. Shannon was interested in medicine because she wanted to help people. As a photo conservator shes still helping people. Im one of the few people that gets to connect the past and the present and the future through preservation, Shannon said. Even though shes not curing colds, Shannon is still helping to protect people by making sure their stories can be shared for years to come. Shes protecting peoples cultural heritage by preserving their photos. In addition to protecting photos, Shannon also works to protect mixed media objects that incorporate photos, such as quilts made with photographic images. Quilts can be made to help keep people warm at night, but theyre also made for lots of other reasons, like artistic expression. By understanding how certain quilts are made, Shannon has helped to make sure that these quilts can be preserved for generations to come. Shannon comes from a family of educators, and shes been able to combine education, science, history and art in her career as a photo conservator. Her work is important when it comes to inspiring and teaching people about the diverse experiences of our world.

2024-04-27 21:39:54,sports,Virat Kholi: Journey Between 70s to 71s Century,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/only-thoughts/virat-kholi-journey-between-70s-to-71s-century-50399/,"Virat Kohli, the Indian cricket teams former captain, has taken the cricket world by storm since his international debut in August 2008. In a short span of time, Kohli has established himself as one of the greatest batsmen of all time and has already amassed an impressive list of records and achievements. Kohlis rise to the top of the cricketing world was not an overnight success story. It was built on years of hard work, determination, and an unrelenting pursuit of excellence. Kohlis aggressive batting style and relentless work ethic have earned him widespread acclaim, and his popularity has only continued to grow with each passing year. In One Day Internationals (ODIs), Kohli has amassed 43 centuries, which is the most by any Indian player and the fifth-most by any player in the world. He has also scored 27 Test centuries, making him one of the few batsmen in the world to have more than 25 centuries in both formats of the game. Kohlis ability to score runs consistently and in high-pressure situations sets him apart from other batsmen. He has a remarkable average of 59.33 in ODIs and 53.25 in Test cricket, which is a testament to his longevity and ability to perform under pressure. Kohlis hunger for success and his never-say-die attitude has earned him the nickname Run Machine. He is a true leader on and off the field, inspiring his teammates with his determination and fierce competitiveness. His exceptional work ethic and passion for the game have made him a role model for young cricketers worldwide. Its important to remember that all athletes, regardless of their skill and success, go through ups and downs in their careers. No one is immune to poor form or struggles, and its not uncommon for even the greatest players to go through rough patches. In Kohlis case, its important to note that he is only human and has faced many challenges, both on and off the field. Its not fair to single him out and criticize him, especially when there are so many other factors at play, such as the impact of COVID-19 on the cricketing calendar and the pressure of performing in high-stakes tournaments like the IPL. Its also important to remember that the criticism he has faced is not representative of the larger cricketing community. Many fans, players, and analysts continue to admire and respect Kohli for his talent and contributions to the sport. As for the criticism towards Kohlis wife and daughter, it is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. Personal lives and family should be off-limits and not used to criticize an athletes performance. But the special thing about time is that it changes. In an Asia Cup 2022 Super Four encounter against Afghanistan in Dubai, Virat Kohli scored his first T20I century for India, breaking a 1019-day wait for his 71st international century. Throughout his innings, Kohli broke a lot of records. In place of Rohit Sharma, the Indian captain, Kohli started the innings. Ibrahim Zadran of Afghanistan dropped Kohli while he was on 28. With 276 runs in five innings, he has now scored the most runs in this Asia Cup. Prior to the competition, Kohli has played in just four T20Is this year, totaling 81 runs in just four innings. The 33-year-old had earlier achieved an international century on November 23, 2019, in Kolkata, during a pink-ball Test match against Bangladesh. ",567
2024-04-27 21:14:59,disease_symptoms,What are pathology tests?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/what-are-pathology-tests/,"Pathologyis a surgical subspecialty, also known as the study of diseases or specific diseases; it is a field of medicine most often associated with the diagnosis and study of diseases such as cancer. More generally, pathology is the study of changes in an organism caused by disease, the normal and abnormal structure, function, and behavior of living systems. Pathology testsare used to diagnose disease. They help reveal the actual cause of specific diseases likeautism, cancer, Crohn’s, and dementia. They can show you problems in the body but treat them by treating the symptoms. Pathology tests simulate what happens to your body when you suffer from a specific disease. Tests are done on the cells of the specific organ in question, and the results help doctors get more information about that particular disease. Various pathology tests: Pathology tests are meant to determine if there is a specific disease or combination of diseases. They differ based on a few diseases and specific criteria for diagnosis. When you get asked by your doctor which test is required for your condition, you will know the difference in pathology testing. These criteria can be found in other medical conditions as well. Unlike lab tests, pathology tests are typically carried out atpathology laboratories, and doctors often have no idea what the results mean. Pathologies have to be diagnosed and the results interpreted first before one expects the final results of such an audiovisual testing program. There are many ways to diagnose a medical condition. The test that is used depends on what we are looking for and how serious the condition is. There are manydifferent types of pathology tests, but they all fall into one of three categories: 1. Blood, urine, and saliva tests (known as “serum” tests) 2. Imaging scans (such as X-rays and ultrasounds) 3. Biopsy samples (tissue samples taken from inside the body) There are two ways to help diagnose more medical conditions. 1. Physical examand a complete medical history, which can be found in most doctor’s offices. Not all doctors offer this type of diagnostic procedure, so it is up to the patient to find one they do. 2. Clinical tests:A clinical test checks blood, urine, or other body fluids for changes in levels of certain chemicals or vitamins, which can indicate disease processes. This type of test requires many hours of work by technicians and can often seem pointless unless the results indicate a significant change in health status. Why are these tests necessary? Pathology tests are a big part of healthcare. These tests are essential, from spotting cancerous cells to determining a patient’s muscle stiffness.  As you have seen, there are many different types of pathology tests. Still, the most basic types focus on removing stains for different cell types, organs, and tissues in their respective exam rooms. 4 reasons why you need apathology testare: 1. Identifies likely health risks:A pathology test can help you determine your risk of developing a specific disease in the future by checking the levels of certainproteins and antibodies in your blood. For example, if you’re worried about heart disease, a cholesterol test is an excellent place to start. 2. Screening for disease:Some pathology tests are used as part of a screening process. For example, if you’re over 40 years old and haven’t had a pap smear before, your doctor might recommend one, so they can check for signs of cervical cancer or other conditions that could cause problems later on. 3. Diagnosing the correct disease:An accurate diagnosis is vital if you have symptoms that point towards a specific condition or disease. This will help your doctor decide what treatment options are best suited to you and whether any further investigations are needed. 4. Monitoring a condition or treatment:Some pathology tests aim to find out how well treatments are working or whether you’ve experienced any changes in your health. For instance, if you have diabetes, you may need regular blood tests to determine how well your glucose levels (blood sugar) are functioning. If you want to get apathology testdone, you have to reach out to a lab specializing in the same. Dr. Remedies Labs is the best in pathology tests, and they offer you the best packages for every test at an affordable price. They even help you get your reports that come from the lab, analyzed.

As his passions grew, he moved from South Korea to America to pursue more advanced academic and career opportunities that aligned with his goals. Hyoungsuk spoke with the Smithsonian Science Education Center about his engineering career journey.  What was your first memorable experience with STEM? When I was 6 years old, my grandfather gifted me a small toy car. He said it would be more interesting if we disassembled the toy and figured out a way to reconstruct it together. I was a small child at the time and didnt have a full understanding of what that meant. All of a sudden, my grandfather disassembled the toy. There were plastic pieces and springs everywhere, and I was curious about how he was going to rebuild the toy. When I look back on that experience, that was my first lesson in reverse engineering. I learned that if I deconstruct a device or a machine, I can understand how it works. My grandfather wanted to show me the methods of how everyday objects operate, so I took that influential experience with me as I grew older and began to examine the details of how other things work.  How were you able to nurture your interests throughout middle and high school? Art and math were major influences of my current career path. I really enjoyed still-life painting and drawing because you have to observe a subject in great detail. I may imagine the color and shape of something, but when I actually analyzed it thoroughly, those details were different. Those observation skills are beneficial because Im now able to view subjects in an objective way instead of subjective. I also enjoyed the problem-solving skills necessary to complete advanced math equations. I had a math workbook and solved all of the problems on my own one summer during middle school. Refining those observation and problem-solving skills were a great foundation for me in engineering.  How did your teachers, mentors, or family members help you pursue your interests? My parents let me explore different subjects and supported those interests by sending me to enrichment programs like art classes, for example. They didnt push me into pursuing one subject over another, they allowed me to navigate things as I grew. Another influential person was my best friend who passed away when he was 20 years old. We had been friends since we were 8 years old, and we started having philosophical conversations in our teenage years. I feel like my personality and character started to develop during that period. He was the type of person who supported and encouraged people deeply, and he encouraged me to go to engineering school.  At what point did you realize that you could turn your passions into a career? In electrical engineering there are a variety of specialties. I was interested in the theoretical part because it involved so many math equations. I fell in love with solving open issues, but they were time intensive. I had my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the time, but it wasnt enough for me to work on more advanced issues. I decided to move to America to pursue my masters, Ph.D, and postdoctoral program. In South Korea, there were many opportunities for me to become a pure researcher to solve mathematical problems. But in the United States, there are more requirements for a theoretical skillset. I wanted to see how the problems I solved influenced people and the world. I found a job that allowed me to cultivate that skillset here at Ofinno.  Did you encounter any barriers to pursuing your STEM goals? When I was 18, I felt like Id lost my way and began to question my career path. In my early 20s I eventually decided to pursue engineering. I was interested in the theoretical part of electrical engineering and wanted to have a more practical skill set and thats why I did my post-doc in America.  Is there anyone that currently inspires you to continue working in this particular field? My parents always inspire me. In South Korea, my parents experienced the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. They were born into a wealthy family, but after the war, all of their property was gone. Those were difficult times for my parents and they always told us about the circumstances they worked to overcome. I realized how incredibly smart my parents were to navigate ways to survive under such harsh conditions. Learning about their sacrifices always motivates me to work hard and overcome barriers.  Can you describe your career path that led you to work at Ofinno? After moving to America, my first job was as an engineer and I worked to resolve wireless communication problems. It was a fun job for me and allowed me to gain more practical experience in my career. I wanted to have more collaboration and communication with colleagues in upper management teams. That motivated me to find a smaller company so that I could have more influence within the production process. Ofinno was a good fit for me because it allowed me to have an impact. Im able to be involved from the beginning to the end of an inventions project management, including working with attorneys to have the invention patented.  ",914
2024-04-27 21:40:09,sports,"Rock, paper, scissors and football",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/whisperings-of-the-heart/rock-paper-scissors-and-football-48419/,"It is midnight in the south Indian state of Kerala. My clock says half an hour past one. But the thunderous festivities from the lively streets outside my apartment suggest otherwise. I rubbed my eyes to confirm the time. Whats happening here?! Christmas Carol?! I mumble. My wife reminds me in a soft note, Messis Argentina won the world cup just a few hours back, dont you remember?! My eight year old son, who had drained every bit of his energy, cheering for and celebrating the ultimate victory of his sporting hero, sleeps peacefully beside me, clad in a white number 10 jersey with sky blue stripes. In a nation which is blindly in love with the so-called gentlemans game, no other sport has managed to assume a stature anywhere closer, not in the past four decades or so. But heres a small strip of land in the southern tip of the peninsula, where legions of football fans take to the streets on a cold December night to watch a South American team locking horns with the reigning champions from Europe for the crowning glory of the game. In this part of the world, cricket is a matter of national pride; but football is an emotion; a passion that runs deep in the veins. Pele or Maradona, Beckham or Figo, Zidane or Klose, Lewandowski or Suarez  no matter what the genealogy or nationality is, takers are aplenty in Gods own country for the heroes of the game. Fan-made effigies of Messi, Neymar and Ronaldo may stand close together and wink a smile at you, from the picturesque riverbanks and verdant valleys of Kerala villages. Players divided by continents are united in the walkways here by the unique passion for the game. This transcending penchant for the game in a tiny pocket of the cricket-crazy subcontinent was a revelation that surprised the world during the just concluded football fiesta. But that was not all.. From the kick-off round which jolted the eventual champions with an abrupt end to their 36-match undefeated streak; to the knock-outs which saw an African team leapfrogging its rivals to gatecrash the prediction charts for the semifinals; and to the final showdown which swayed back and forth until that destined moment of ceremonial crowning of Lionel Messi as the most accomplished player of all time  this tournament kept throwing up surprises at each stage, making it a true rollercoaster ride for the teams and the fans alike. As I were to realise later, the surprises were far from over!! The day after the grand finale, as I walked back home in the evening, expecting to see my little Messi having a roll with the ball on the grass, what awaited me was an inexplicably quiet playing area. To my astonishment, the boy was spotted indoors in the company of his friend, mesmerizingly bound to the palpable excitement of the finger game they were playing  Rock, paper, scissors. Is this the same boy who was kicking imaginary footballs in air last night, craving to emulate the heroics of the one whose name he was bearing on his jersey?! Was all that excitement meant to be too short-lived? Inspite of all the inspiration garnered for daily physical activity, are we back to square one?!! My heart sank.. Son, how do you master football by sitting in a corner and making gestures with your hands. Football is a physical sport- a game of agility, fitness and finesse. But Appa, one needs to practise this as well to win the world cup!!  he retorted dismissively, without taking eyes off his playmates hand. What?!- I was shell-shocked. You mean to say that they won the cup by sheer luck, and not skills? Rock paper scissors is not about luck, Appa. Its about mind-reading skills. Didnt you see who snatched the game in the end last night?!! I was flabbergasted. As I quietly sank into the sofa staring blankly at their hand game and reminiscing the final moments of the penalty shoot-out, the logic behind the eight-year-olds observation slowly dawned on my senescing wits. Despite Messis wizardry, despite De Marias brilliance, despite all the exuberance and exhilaration that lasted 120 minutes of scintillating soccer, as the evasive moment of glory refused to side up with either of the teams, it was the intuitive accuracy of one man, that cracked the impasse and sealed the history for Messis marauders  Emiliano Martinez, the man with the golden gloves. As my son stared at his playmates eyes in anticipation of making the next gesture, the towering image of a vibrant Martinez jouncing under the bar flashed before my eyes. On that historic night of fluctuating fortunes, as Emiliano Martinez geared up to face the penalty kicks, three out of his four dives were spot-on, as if he was reading the strikers mind. Even Kylian Mbappe would have let out a huge sigh of relief, as his high octane strike jostled past the clairvoyant goalkeepers left hand into the nets. Rock, paper or scissors  Right, left or centre! In the run-up to the world cup, could Martinez have been mastering the meditative art of guessing the rocks, papers, and scissors with his masterly hands day in and day out, as the little one seemed to suggest?! Well, whether he was or not, as little Messi rightly pointed out, mind games win football matches too!! I withdrew quietly from the scene with a smile of enlightenment, as their little hands geared up for the next penalty kick!! ",925
